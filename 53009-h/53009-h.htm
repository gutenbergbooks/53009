</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Who alone, of all foreigners, has detected, in its full significance, that
the motive power, the cohering force, the ultimate religion of that
strange composite known as “The American,” is Individual Will.
Leaving the ultra-religious element out of the question, the high,
the low, the rich, the poor, the man, the woman of this section of
the Western world, each, consciously or unconsciously, believes in,
relies on himself primarily. In the higher civilisation this amounts
to intellectual anarchy, and its tendency is to make Americans, or,
more exactly, United Statesians, a New Race in a sense far more
portentous than in any which has yet been recognised. As M. Bourget
prophesies, destruction, chaos, may eventuate. On the other hand,
the final result may be a race of harder fibre and larger faculties than
any in the history of civilisation. That this extraordinary self-dependence
and independence of certain traditions that govern older nations
make the quintessential part of the women as of the men of this race
I have endeavoured to illustrate in the following pages.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, git up! Git up! Did you ever see such an old
slug? Billy! <span class='it'>Will</span> you git up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of talking to him?” drawled a
soft, inactive voice. “You know he never goes one
bit faster. What’s the difference anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Difference is my mother wants these groceries for
supper. We’re all out of sugar ’n flour ’n beans, and
the men’s got to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as long as he won’t go, just be comfortable
and don’t bother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could be as easy-going as you are, Rosita,
but I can’t: I suppose it’s because I’m not Spanish.
Guess I’ve got some Yankee in me, if I am a Californian.”
The little girl leaned over the dash-board of
the rickety buggy, thumping with her whip-stump the
back of the aged nag. Billy was blind, uncertain in
the knees, and as languid as any <span class='it'>caballero</span> that once
had sighed at <span class='it'>doña’s</span> feet in these dim pine woods.
As far back as Patience could remember he had never
broken his record, and his record was two miles an
hour. In a few moments she set the whip in the socket
with an irritable thump, wound the reins about it, and
sat down on the floor beside her companion. For
some reason best known to themselves, the girls preferred
this method of disposition when Billy led the
way,—perhaps because he had an errant fondness for
the roughest spots of the rough road, making the high
seat as uneasy and precarious as thrones are still; perhaps
because Patience rebelled at habit, and in all her
divagations was blindly followed by her Spanish friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Billy ambled up and down the steep roads of the
fragrant pine woods on the hills behind Monterey, and
the girls gave him no further heed. Patience’s long
plait having been shaken loose in her wild lurches over
the dash-board, she swung about, dangled her legs out
of the buggy, and commanded Rosita to braid her hair.
The legs she kicked recklessly against the wheel were
not pretty. They were long and thin, clothed with
woollen stockings darned and wrinkled, and angled off
with copper-toed boots. She wore a frock of faded
gingham, and chewed the strings of a sunbonnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t pull so, and do hurry,” she exclaimed as the
Spanish girl’s deft slow fingers moved in and out of the
scanty wisps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not pulling, Patita, dear, and you know I can’t
hurry. And I’m just thinking that your hair is the
colour of ashes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Patience, gloomily, “but maybe
it’ll be yellow when I grow up. Do you remember
Polly Collins? When she graduated she had hair the
colour of a wharf rat, and when she came back from
San Francisco the next year it was as yellow as the hills
in summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care for yellow hair,” and Rosita moved
her dark head with the slow rotary motion which was
hers by divine right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re pretty,” said Patience, sarcastically.
“You want to be told so, I suppose—There! you
pulled my hair on purpose, you know you did, Rosita
Thrailkill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t, Patita. Don’t fire up so.” And Rosita,
who was the most amiable of children, tied the end of
the braid with a piece of tape, rubbed her blooming
cheek against the pale one, and was forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience drew herself into the buggy and braced her
back against the seat. Her face had little more beauty
than her legs. It was colourless and freckled. The
mouth was firm, almost dogged, as if the contest with
life had already begun. Her brows and lashes were
several shades darker than her hair, but her eyes, wide
apart and very bright, were a light, rather cold grey.
The nose alone was a beautiful feature, straight and
fine; and the hands, although rough and sunburned,
were tapering and slender, and very flexible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her red frock, the highly-coloured little Spanish
girl glowed like a cactus blossom beside a neglected
weed. Her plump face was full of blood; her large
dark eyes were indolent and soft. Patience’s eyes
comprehended everything within their radius in one
flashing glance; Rosita’s, even at the tender age of
fifteen, looked unswerving disapproval of all exertion,
mental or physical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if your mother is drunk?” she asked in
her slow delicious voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Likely,” said Patience, with frowning resignation.
“But let’s talk of something more agreeable. Isn’t
this perfume heavenly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark solemn woods were ravishing with the perfumes
of spring, the perfume of wild violet and lilac
and lily, and the faint sweet odour the damp earth gives
up as the sun goes down. From above came the strong
bracing scent of the pines. Now and again the wind
brought a salt whiff from the ocean. No birds carolled,
but the pines sang their eternal dirge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your ideal?” demanded Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ideal? What ideal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of man, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, man!” contemptuously. “I haven’t thought
much about men. I don’t read novels like you do. I
wish somebody would die and leave me a thousand
dollars so I could live in San Francisco and have a new
dress every day and go to the theatre every night.
Miss Galpin says we mustn’t think about boys, and I
don’t—perhaps because the boys in Monterey are so
horrid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys? Who said anything about boys?” The
chrysalis elevated her patrician nose. “I mean
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re mean to turn up your nose at boys.
They like you a good deal better than they do me, and
a good many of the other girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s funny, isn’t it? and I not pretty. But I
suppose it’s because I talk. You just sit still and look
pretty, and that’s not very entertaining. I read in a
novel that men like that; but boys have got to be
entertained. Goodness gracious! Don’t I know it?
When I was at Manuela’s party the other night in my
old washed muslin frock and plaid sash, didn’t I talk
my throat sore to make them forget that I was the
worst dressed girl in the room and had the most
freckles? Of course the girls didn’t forget—nor some
other things—” with a bitter lowering of the lids—“but
the boys did. Somehow I feel as if men would
always be my friends, if I’m not pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know about men, anyhow? You’re
only fifteen, and you’ve never met any but old Mr.
Foord, and the farm hands and store keepers, who,”
aristocratically, “don’t count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I read novels? Haven’t I read Thackeray
and Dickens and Scott and ‘Jane Eyre’ and ‘Wuthering
Heights’ and Shakespeare and Plutarch’s Lives, and
the life of Napoleon and Macaulay’s ‘History of England’
and Essays—those all ain’t novels, but they write
about men, real men, too. I’ve made my ideal out of
a lot of them put together, and I’ll never marry till I
find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d like to know where you’ll find him in
Monterey,” said the practical Rosita. “Miss Galpin
says you’re too romantic, and that it’s a pity, because
you’re the brightest girl in the school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Miss Galpin say that?” Patience took a brass
pin out of her frock and extracted a splinter from her
thumb with a fine air of indifference; but the pink
flooded her cheek. “She’s always reading Howells
and James, and says they’d keep anybody from being
romantic. But that’s about all I’ve got, so I think
I’ll hold on to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun dropped below the horizon as they jolted
out of the woods and down the steep road toward
Carmel Valley. They reached a ledge, and Patience,
forgetful of hungry men and an irascible parent, called:
“Whoa!” to which Billy responded with an alacrity
reserved for such occasions only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never get tired of this,” she said. “Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty,” said Rosita, indifferently. “Why are
you so fond of scenery—nature, as Miss Galpin calls
it—I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Patience, and at that age she
did not. She was responsive but dumb. She gazed
down and out and upward with a pleasure that never
grew old. A great bleak mountain loomed on the
other side of the valley. It was as steep as if the
ocean had gnawed it flat, but only the peaceful valley
lay under; out in the ocean it tapered to an immense
irregular mass of rock over which the breakers leapt
and fought. Carmel River sparkled peacefully beneath
its moving willows. The blue bay murmured to the
white sands with the peace of evening. Close to the
little beach the old Mission hung its dilapidated head.
Through its yawning arches dark objects flitted; mould
was on the yellow walls; from yawning crevice the
rank grass grew. Only the tower still defied elements
and vandals, although the wind whistled through its gaping
windows and the silver bells were no more. The
huts about the church had collapsed like old muscles,
but in their ruin still whispered the story of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it splendid to think that we have a ruin!”
exclaimed Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a ruin sure enough; but there’s uncle Jim.
He must think we’re dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A prolonged “Halloa!” came from the valley, and
Patience, with a sigh, bade Billy “Git up,” which he
did in the course of a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halloa, you youngsters, why don’t you hurry?”
cried a nasal voice. “I’ve been waiting here an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming,” said Patience. “It’s too bad he had
to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he smoked and swore, so he’s all right,” said
Rosita, who had not taken the trouble to reply. None
of the girls was allowed to visit Patience at her house;
but Mrs. Thrailkill, who was fond of her daughter’s
chosen friend, and pitiful in her indolent way, often
allowed Patience to drive Rosita as far as the branching
of the roads, where the Kentucky uncle met his
niece and took her to his farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dusk below a wagon and two horses could be
seen, and a big man under a wide straw hat, sitting on
the upper rail of a fence, his heels hooked to the rail
below. Patience inferred that he was chewing tobacco
and expectorating upon the poppies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I reckon!” he exclaimed as the buggy
reached the foot of the hill. “You two do beat all.
Do you s’pose I’ve got nothing better to do than moon
round pikes waiting on kids like you? How’s your
ma, Rosita? Well, Patience, I won’t keep you—much
obliged for giving my lazy Spanish niece a lift.
Come on now; supper’s ready ’n after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two little girls kissed each other affectionately.
Mr. Thrailkill lifted Rosita down, and Patience turned
Billy in the direction of a fiery eye and a dim column
of smoke under the mountain. The evening seemed
very quiet after the rattle of Mr. Thrailkill’s team had
become a part of the distance. Only the roar of the
surf, the moaning of the pines, the harsh music of the
frogs, the thousand vocal mysteries of night—not a
sound of man. Patience, after her fashion, rehabilitated
the Mission and peopled the valley with padres and
Indians; but when Billy came to a sudden halt, she
sprang prosaically to the ground and let down the bars
of her mother’s ranch. After she had replaced them
she took hold of Billy’s bridle, and endeavoured, by
jerks and expostulation, to induce him to move more
rapidly. The road now lay through a ploughed field
stretching gloomily on the east to the horizon, where
the stars seemed dropping into the dark. Cows
roamed at will, or lay heavily in their first sleep. Here
and there an oak thrust out its twisted arms, its trunk
bent backward by ocean winds. The house soon became
plainly outlined, a long unpainted wooden story-and-a-half
structure, the type of ranch house of the
second era. Castilian roses clambered up the unpainted
front. Clumps of gladiolus, pinks, and fuschias
struggled with weeds in the front garden. Beyond
was a number of out-buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience reached the porch she dropped
Billy’s bridle, lifted out the sugar, and stepping to the
kitchen window, looked through it for a moment before
opening the door. Her mother was very drunk.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The room into which Patience frowned was a large
rough kitchen of the old familiar type. The rafters
were festooned with cobwebs, through which tin cans
and aged pails were visible, and an occasional bundle
of rags. The board walls were unplastered and unpainted.
Out of the uneven floor, knots had dropped
to the cellar below. The door of a cupboard, built
against the wall with primitive simplicity, stood open,
revealing a motley collection of cans, bottles, and
cracked dishes. Pots and pans were heaped on a shelf
traversing two sides of the room. A table was loaded
with odds and ends, in the midst of which place had
been made for a lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over a large stove a woman was frying bacon and
eggs. She wore a brown calico garment, torn and
smudged. Her fine black hair, sprinkled with ashes,
hung raggedly above magnificent dark eyes, blinking in
a crimson face. The thin nostrils and full mouth were
twitching. In her ruin she was still a beautiful woman,
and she moved her tall bloated form with the pride of
race, despite the alcohol in her veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a broken chair by the stove sat a young man in
the overalls and flannel shirt of a farm hand. His hair
was clipped to his skull with colourless result; his large
red under lip curved down into a yellow beard. In a
long low room adjoining the kitchen a half dozen other
men were seated on benches about a table covered with
white oilcloth and chipped crockery. They also wore
overalls and flannel shirts; and they were bearded and
seamed and brown. The Californian sun soon burns
the juices out of the flesh that defies it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience flung open the kitchen door and threw the
sugar on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oscar,” she said peremptorily to the man by the
stove, “take Billy round to the barn and put him up,
and bring in the flour and the beans. They’re under
the seat.” The man went out, muttering angrily, and
she turned to her mother, who had begun a tirade of
abuse. “Keep quiet,” she said. “So you’re drunk
again? I thought you promised me that you wouldn’t
drink again for a week. Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t help it,” muttered the woman, cowed by
the bitter contempt in her small daughter’s eyes, and
thrusting a long fork into the sputtering fat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience opened the package of sugar with a jerk,
and filling two bowls with the coarse brown stuff carried
them into the next room and set them at opposite ends
of the table. The men ceased talking as she entered,
and saluted her respectfully. They felt vaguely sorry
for her; but they were afraid of her, and she was not a
favourite with them. Her mother, “Madge,” as they
called her to a man, they worshipped, despite or
because of her peccability. They went down before
her deathless magnetism, her coarse good nature, her
spurious kind-heartedness. It was only when very drunk
that she became violent and vituperative, and even then
she fascinated them. Patience told herself proudly that
she had no attraction for “common men”—that she
repelled them. Not being a seer, she was saved the
foreknowledge of a fatal gift in operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the large coffee-pot from the back of the
stove and filled the men’s cups with its thick fluid.
Her mother’s rolling eyes followed her with a malignant
sparkle. She was afraid of her daughter, and resentment
had eaten deep into her perverted nature.
Patience filled a plate with bread and apple sauce, and
went into the parlour to eat her supper in solitude. She
took all her meals in this room, which with little difficulty
she appropriated to her exclusive use: it was very
small. She kept it in fairly good order: she was not
the tidiest of children. But the old brussels carpet was
clean, barring the corners, and the horsehair furniture
had been mended here and there with shoe thread.
As it still prickled, however, Patience had made a
cushion for the clumsy rocker out of an elderly gown
which she had found in a trunk in the garret with other
relics of finery. She occupied the rocker impartially
whether eating or reading. The marble-topped table
also served for dining and study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a forlorn old bookcase were her only treasures,
the few books, mostly classics, which John Sparhawk
had reserved when a succession of failures had forced
him to sell his library to Mr. Foord. In one corner
was a large family Bible on a small table. It was old
and worn. Its gilt edges shone dimly through a cobweb
of infinite pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the papered walls were two large coloured photographs
of Mr. and Mrs. Sparhawk, taken apparently
when each was close on thirty years. The woman’s
face bore traces of dissipation even then, and the red
mouth was very sensual. But the cheeks were still
delicate and there were no bags under the large flaming
eyes. The bare neck and arms and half revealed bust
were superb; the poise of the head, the curve of the
short upper lip, the fine arched nostril, were the delicate
insignia of race; the pride stamped on every
feature was that of birth, not of defiance. The man
had a slender upright figure and a finely modelled head
and face. The deeply set eyes were cold and piercing,
but between the stern curves of the mouth there was
much passion. Patience had studied these faces, but
she was as innocent as if she had been bred in a cloister,
and their mystery baffled while it allured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ate her supper with a hearty appetite. Her
mother’s lapses, being accepted as part of the routine
of existence, rarely depressed her spirits. Nevertheless
she frowned heavily as turbulent sounds pierced the
thin partition, not so much at her mother’s iniquity, as
at the prospect of being obliged to wash the supper
dishes. The expected crash came, and she ran into the
kitchen. Her mother lay prone. Two of the men
lifted her immediately and carried her up the narrow
stair. Patience sullenly attacked the dishes. She
dumped them into a large pan of hot water, stirred them
gingerly with a cloth fastened to a stick, drained the
water off, poured in a fresh pailful, and dried them
hastily. She filled the frying-pan with water and set it
on the hottest part of the stove to cook itself clean.
Occasionally she coughed with angry significance: the
men in the next room were invisible behind a grey fog
of their own puffing. She spattered her clean pinafore,
blackened her hands, and devoutly wished herself alone
on a desert island where she could live on cocoanuts
and bananas. At such times she forgot the few compensations
of her unfortunate life and felt herself only
the poverty-stricken drudge, the daughter of Madge
Sparhawk.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Who Madge Sparhawk was before she married the
Yankee rancher had at one time been an absorbing
topic for dispute in Monterey. One gossip averred
that she had been the dashing leader of the lower ten
thousand of San Francisco, another that she had come
from the Eastern States as the mistress of a wealthy
man who had wearied and cast her off; a third confidently
affirmed that she had been a brilliant New
York woman of fashion who had gone wrong through
love of drink, and been sent under an assumed
name to California by her afflicted family; a fourth
swore that she had been an actress, a fifth that she
had been the high-tempered queen of a gambling
house. On one point all agreed: she was disreputable,
and John Sparhawk was a fool to marry her. However,
they were somewhat disappointed that they saw
so little of her. They were not called upon to snub
nor tolerate her. She rarely came into the town; never
excepting on horseback with her husband, when her
splendid beauty drew masculine Monterey from its
perch on the fence tops,—where it sat and smoked
and murmured the hours away,—and gathered it about
her, stirring the diluted rill of <span class='it'>caballero</span> blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the little world of Monterey could learn
through the gossip of servants, she was a helpful wife
to a devoted husband who patiently strove with the
fiend that possessed her. When he was killed by the
accidental discharge of a gun her grief was so violent
that only a prolonged carouse could assuage it. Subsequently
she recovered, and with occasional advice
from Mr. Foord attempted to run the farm. As John
Sparhawk had made no will, she was her child’s legal
guardian, the absolute mistress for eight years of what
property her husband had left. There was a little
ready money, the dairy was remunerative, and the ranch
well stocked. But that was five years ago. Her habits
had grown upon her; the ranch was mortgaged and
run down, the stock decreased by half.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had rebelled heavily at her father’s death,
and wondered, with childish logic, why, if one parent
had to die, it could not have been her mother. Her
father’s manner had been cold, repellent, like her own;
but that his nature was deep and passionate even her
young mind had never doubted. She felt it in the
close clasp of his arms as he held her before him on his
horse when galloping about the ranch; in his sudden
infrequent caress; in the strong pressure of his hand as
they wandered through the woods or along the shore at
night, not a word spoken between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until after his death that she made acquaintance
with her social separateness. He had
begun her education himself. Her only girl companion
was Rosita Thrailkill, the niece of a neighbour, whom
her father would not permit her to visit in Monterey.
John Sparhawk’s only friends were the Thrailkill brothers
and Mr. Foord, an elderly gentleman, who had lived in
Monterey under the old régime, lost his fortune in the
great Bonanza time, and returned to the somnolent
town to end his days with his library, the memory of
his dead Spanish wife, and a few old friends, world-forgotten
like himself. He lived in the dilapidated
Custom House on the rocks at the edge of the town,
and Patience had ruled his establishment since her
baby days. It was the only house in Monterey she was
permitted to enter, and she entered it as often as she
could. A hundred times she had sat with the old
gentleman on the upper corridor and listened to the
story of the capture of Monterey by the United States
fleet in 1846; stared breathlessly at the crumbling fort—the
<span class='it'>castillo</span>—on the hill above Junipero Serra’s
cross, as Mr. Foord verbally restored its former impregnability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her tales of the days of light and life and
joy when Monterey was the capital of the Californians,
and the Americans were not yet come,—stories of love
and revenge and the great free play of the primitive
passions, unpared by modern civilisation. For her
those old adobe houses in the town were alive once
more with dark-eyed <span class='it'>doñas</span> and magnificently attired
<span class='it'>caballeros</span>. Behind the high walls of the old gardens
fans fluttered among the Castilian roses and dueñas
stealthily prowled. The twisted streets were gay again
with the court life of the olden time, the grand parades
of the governors, the triumphant returns from the race
on the restless silver-trapped steeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every house had its history, and Patience knew them
all. She wandered with Mr. Foord along the dusty
streets, lingered before the garden walls, over which she
could see and smell the nasturtiums and the sweet
Castilian roses. But gone were the <span class='it'>caballeros</span> and the
<span class='it'>doñas</span>. They lay in the little cemetery of the <span class='it'>padres</span>
on the hill, over beyond the yellow church which
marked a corner of the old <span class='it'>presidio</span>, and well on the
road to a great hotel whose typical life was vastly different
from that old romantic time. They lay under
their stones, forgotten. The thistles and wild oats
rioted under the gnarled old oaks. The new-comer
never paused to glance at the worn carvings on the
thick rough slabs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the garden walls a few brown old women
lived alone, too practical to brood upon an enchanted
past. Cows nibbled in the <span class='it'>plaza</span> where once the bull
and the bear had fought while the gay jewelled people
screamed with delight. Gone was the tinkle of the
guitar, the flutter of fan, the graceful woman hastening
down the street half hidden in her mantilla, the
lovely face behind the grating. The screaming of the
sea-gulls, the moaning of the pines, the roar of the surf,
alone remained the same, careless of change or decay.
Wooden houses crowded between the old adobes.
Most of the Spanish families were half American: their
women had preferred the enterprising intruder to the
indolent <span class='it'>caballero</span>. Arcadia was no more. The old had
kissed the hand of the new, and spawned a hybrid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After John Sparhawk’s death, Mr. Foord persuaded
his widow to send Patience to the public school. The
little girl was delighted. She had looked with envious
longing at the stone building, painted a beautiful pink,
which stood well up on the hill at the right of the town
and was still known by the imposing name of Colton
Hall; it had been built by the first American <span class='it'>alcalde</span>,
and was a court house for a brief while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not long before Patience learned the
bitter lesson that she was not as other girls, despite
the fact that at that time she was well dressed and that
she drifted naturally to the head of her classes. School
girls are coarse and cruel. Children are the periodical
relapse of civilisation into savagery. These girls of
Monterey excluded Patience from their games and
recess conversations, and intimated broadly that her
mother was not respectable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Patience gave them little heed. She loved
study, and was of a wild happy nature beneath her prim
exterior. Moreover, Rosita was her loyal friend; and
one of the older girls, Manuela Peralta, who had a kind
and independent heart, sheltered her as much as she
could. But Patience was too bright and observing to
remain long in ignorance of her hostile environment.
When the awakening came her young soul was filled
with rage and bitterness. The full meaning of their
innuendoes she was too ignorant to understand, but that
she was regarded as a pariah was sufficiently evident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little as she loved her mother, a natural impulse sent
her to her only remaining parent with the story of her
wrongs. Mrs. Sparhawk became violently indignant
and shortly after very drunk. The subject was never
mentioned between them again; nor did Patience
speak of it with any one but Rosita, whom she regarded
as a second, beloved, and somewhat inferior self. But
her soul cried out for the strength that only a man’s
strong soul can give to woman at any age; and the
man that had prayed to live and defend her lay with
the forgotten Californians on the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Foord divined her trouble, and did what he
could to make her life endurable, although her shy
reserve forbade any intimacy beyond the old friendship.
Miss Galpin, her teacher, made no secret of
the fact that Patience was her favourite scholar, and
encouraged her to study and read and forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience indulged in no further outbreak, even to
herself. She cultivated a cold and impassive exterior,
an air of rigid indifference, and studied until her small
head ached. She was not old enough to analyse; it
was instinct only that made her assume callousness;
but in her young vague way she grappled with the
social problem. She did not approve of Mrs. Sparhawk
any more than others did; but Mrs. Sparhawk’s
daughter behaved herself, and stood at the
head of her classes, and had been assured again and
again that she “looked like a little lady:” therefore
she was at a loss to comprehend why Patience Sparhawk
was not as good as other girls. There was
Panchita McPherson, who lied profusely and whose
mother sat in the sun all day and baked herself like an
old crocodile, while her husband sat on the fence by
the Post Office and smoked a pipe from the first of
January until the thirty-first of December. Yet Panchita
was of the <span class='it'>haute noblesse</span>, and treated Patience as
she would a rag-picker. Francesca Montez never
knew a lesson and was so vulgar that she brought the
blush to Patience’s cheek; but she lived in an adobe
mansion which once had been the scene of princely
splendour, and gave two parties a year. The American
girls had not even the prestige of the past; they could
not reckon up a great-grandfather between them, much
less peeling portraits of <span class='it'>caballeros</span> and trunks of splendid
finery; but they were bright and aggressive, and made
themselves a power in the school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patience grew older she compelled the respect of
her mates, and they ceased to annoy her. The consciousness
of social supremacy never faded, not for an
instant; but even tying a tin can to a dog’s tail becomes
monotonous in time, and they had numberless little
interests to absorb them. If Patience had been a rollicking
emotional child she would doubtless have kissed
herself into popularity and been treated to much good-natured
patronage; but she scorned placation, and grew
more reserved as the years went by. She accepted her
fate, and discovered that there were times and hours
when her mother, schoolmates, and social problems
could be forgotten. Her spirits were naturally buoyant,
and her mind grew philosophical; but as Mr. Foord
once observed to Miss Galpin, “her start in life had
been all wrong, and it would matter more with her
than with some others.”</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>After Patience had put the kitchen in order she went
up to her room. She slept at one end of the house,
her mother at the opposite. Several of the hired men
occupied a dormitory between; the rest slept over the
dairy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lit her candle and began to undress, then extinguished
the flame suddenly and went down stairs
and out of the house. She felt sullen and heavy and
depressed, and knew the remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was at the full; the great ploughed fields
were a sea of silver; the dark pines on the hills
opened their aisles to cataracts of crystal, splashing
through the green uplifted arms. Strange shadows
moved amidst the showers of cold light, twisting rhythmically
under the touch of the night wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience loved nature too passionately to fear her in
any mood or hour. She sped over the rough field,
climbed the fence, and walked hastily toward the Mission,
pausing now and again to inhale the rich perfumes
of Spring. The ruin looked like the skeleton of
a mammoth caught in a phantom iceberg. Even the
dark things that haunted it were touched to beauty by
the silver light pouring through the storm-beaten rose
window over the massive doors, into the abysms between
the arches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience skirted the long body of the church with
haste; mouldering skeletons lay under the floor, and
like all imaginative minds she had a lively horror of the
dead. She entered the open doorway and ascended
the steep spiral stair in the tower. The steps were cut
from solid stone and were worn by the trampling of
many feet. As she neared the top she called,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tu wit! Tu woo!” and was promptly answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her chin appeared above the floor of the little
room, where the moonlight came through hollow casements,
an old grey owl, a large wise solemn owl, advanced
from the wall with slow and stately step; and
despite his massive dignity there was expectancy in
his mien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Solomon,” said Patience, contritely. “I forgot
your supper.” She climbed into the room and
attempted to pat his head; but when he saw that the
hand was empty, he flapped his wings, and turning his
back upon her, retired to the wall, blinking indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience laughed, then sighed, and sank on her knees
before the low window overlooking the ocean. The
blue bay still whispered to the white sands sparkling
like diamond dust in the moonlight, the yellow stars
winking in its clear depths. But the ocean was uneasy,
and hurtled reiterantly in great deep-throated waves
at the rocky shore as if its giant soul were in final rebellion
against this conventional war with a passive foe.
About Point Lobos its voice waxed trumpet-toned. It
shouldered itself into mighty waves and tossed the spray
into writhing shapes. Everything else was at rest. The
great forces of nature were the angry prisoners of the
tides. The moon grinned in his superior way. The little
stars seemed to say: “Up here we are quite composed,
and as vain as pretty women. If you would only keep
quiet you would make such a fine large looking-glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patience gazed out upon the beautiful scene, her
young mind shifted its impressions. She forgot her life,
and began to dream in a vague sweet way. Not of a
lover. Despite the fact that she had manufactured a
composite which occupied a pedestal in her imagination,
she thought little about love. Her reveries were
a wandering of her ego through the books she had read,
environed by the nature whom she knew only in lovely
profile. Had she lived her fifteen years on the sterile
plains of Soledad, she might perhaps have been as
harsh and bitter as its sands, her soul as grey, so susceptible
was she to the subtle influence of great externals.
But Monterey had saved her, and on nights like
this she felt as if she too were flooded with crystal light,
now and again clouded by something which perturbed,
yet vibrated like the music of the pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in a particularly romantic mood, she imagined
herself Mariana in the “Moated Grange,” or hummed
“The Long Long Weary Day,” and tried to feel sad,
but could not. She never felt sad in her tower, with
the owl on guard and the slighted dead in the church
below. Sometimes she took herself to task for not
having a proper amount of sentiment, but concluded
that no one could be unhappy when so high above the
world and all its hateful details. Occasionally she
looked longingly at the perpendicular mountain: it
was many times higher than her tower; but she was
a lazy little thing, and would not climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she knelt, gazing out on the ocean, or up at the
spangled night, she was a very different-looking being
from the sharp practical child that had exhorted
old Billy and berated her mother. The loosened hair
clung softly about her pale face, whose freckles the kind
moon with his white brush painted out. Her mouth
had relaxed its stern lines. Her eyes were full of the
moon’s shimmer, and of something else,—the struggling
light of a developing soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience’s soul had taken care of itself and showed
virility in spite of the forces at war against it. What
the little battling spark strove for, puzzled Patience
even at that unanalytical age. Religion—Christianity,
to be more exact—said nothing to her; it appealed
to no want in her; even the instinct was lacking. John
Sparhawk had clung to the rigid faith of his fathers
with a desperation which Patience, child as she was,
had half divined. He had had prayers night and
morning, and compelled his daughter to learn her
catechism and many chapters of the Bible. After his
death Mr. Foord took her to church on Sunday mornings
and occasionally read her a little lecture. She
listened respectfully, but felt no interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, when alone in her tower at night,
when she had set her foot on its lowest step with deliberate
intent to get as high above the earth as she
could, she was conscious of an upreaching of the spiritual
entity within her, a wordless demand for the something
higher and holier of which the supreme beauty of
the Universe is symbolical.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, Patience, after helping her convalescent
parent to get breakfast, stood on the porch
debating whether she should go over to Mr. Thrailkill’s
ranch and see Rosita or spend the day in Mr. Foord’s
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scholars of Colton Hall had a week’s vacation,
and how to make the most of seven long days of
freedom in exquisite spring weather was a serious
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she hesitated she bethought herself of Solomon.
She ran to the safe, and gingerly extracting a piece of
raw meat wrapped it in a newspaper, and went over to
the Mission. The owl had not moved, apparently, from
the spot where he had taken his indignant stand the
night before. When he scented the meat, however,
he walked majestically forward, and taking no notice
whatever of Patience, began at once upon the meal she
spread at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had decided in favour of the library, and
started leisurely for Monterey. The ocean rested
heavily after its labour of the night, swinging forward at
long intervals with deep murmur, or throwing an occasional
iridescent cloud of spray about Point Lobos.
The keen air sparkled under a flood of golden light.
The earth was green with the deep rich green of spring.
Great bunches of it sprang from even the ragged mountain
side, and long blades struggled to life between
the broken tiles of the old Mission. Patience crossed
the valley through beds of golden poppies and pale
blue baby-eyes struggling with infantile pertinacity to
raise themselves above the waving grass. She plucked
a poppy and held her nose in the great cup that
covered half her face. She liked the slight languor its
heavy perfume induced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She climbed the hill, and the woods shut out the
world. Patience forgot her destination and wandered
happily and aimlessly in the dim fragrance. She plucked
some pine needles, and rubbing their juices free pressed
her hands about her face. On the whole she preferred
their pungent freshness to the poppy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she began to skip over the carpet of
yellow violets and to sing in a high childish treble. She
was only a happy little girl with her lungs full of oxygen,
her veins warmed by the sun, her heart exhilarated with
the surpassing beauty of the morning. She threw pebbles
at the squirrels and laughed loudly when they scampered
up the stately trees. Spiritual problems did not trouble
her, and social trials were forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dawdled away the earlier hours of the morning in
the woods, then descending the hill on the town side,
regained her severe and elderly demeanour. The ocean
was not visible here, but a bay bluer than sapphire curved
into sands whiter than marble dust. The sun shone
down on the red-tiled white adobes, on the high garden
walls pink with Castilian roses, as gaily as in the old
Arcadian time. But alas! it shone also on cheap
wooden cottages and shops which had invaded even
the hill on the right, where once a few stately mansions
stood alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town was very quiet. It was always quiet.
Some holy unheard voice seemed ever saying “Hush!”
As Patience walked down Alvarado Street to the Custom
House, she saw a slender brown woman watering the
roses behind her garden wall. She had been the belle
of Monterey in her time, “La Tulita,” and tradition
had it that she still watered a rose-bush which General
Sherman had planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next block several dark lads sat on a fence in
the approved Montereño style, smoking <span class='it'>cigaritos</span>. As
Patience passed they lifted their caps as gallantly as
ever <span class='it'>caballero</span> had done, although they did not fling
them at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw no one else until she reached the Custom
House. Mr. Foord stood on the corridor that overhung
the rocks. He was a large round-shouldered man, with
a benign face the colour of aging marble and a brow of
the old time intellectual type. The eyes behind his
spectacles were dim and kind. The lower part of his
face was humorous and stern. He wore a silk hat, a
well-brushed suit of broadcloth, and carried a gold-headed
cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to town!” cried Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” he said smiling, “and I suppose you are
going to read your eyes out in the library. Well, I’ll
not be back until to-morrow, so you’ll have things all
your own way. Tell Lola to cook you some dinner.
I must be off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me a box of candy,” she commanded, as she
stood on tiptoe to give him the little peck she called a
kiss. It was her mark of supreme consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He promised, and she went into the library, a large
room opening on the corridor, where many a great ball
had been given in the days before and after the Americans
came. A half dozen old-fashioned bookcases,
crowded with books, stood against the walls of the
low room. The books were bound in spotted calf or
faded cloth, black cloth with peeling gilt letters. One
large case contained John Sparhawk’s library, and
Patience knew that it was practically hers. The floor
was covered with a thick red carpet. A large easy-chair
was drawn before the deep fire-place, in which a
huge log crackled: it was still winter within adobe
walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Altogether,” thought the philosopher of fifteen, as
she flung her sunbonnet on the floor, “I guess that so
long as I’ve got my tower and the woods and this room,
I’m not so badly off as some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She roamed about the room, opening the doors of the
bookcases in turn. One case had been filled with
books selected for her especial use, but Mr. Foord had
not forbidden her the freedom of the others, being
wiser than many guardians. Nevertheless, certain books
were placed on top shelves, their titles concealed
beneath the moulding of the case, and Patience had
looked speculatively at them more than once. To-day
they exerted a peculiar fascination. And it was rarely
that she was alone in the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She possessed an investigating and tentative mind, and
this forbidden territory appealed eloquently to her
unruly will. But to get them out was not an easy task.
They were tightly packed, and the moulding was like
unto a prison bar. But Patience was a person of
resource. She gave one of the books a smart thump,
and it slanted inward. She inserted her thumb under
its lifted edge and worried it out. It was a small
volume bound in black, its lettering worn away. She
opened it and glanced curiously at the titlepage.
“Boccaccio’s Decameron” winked invitingly. The
pages were spotted with yellow. The drawings looked
as if the stories might be reasonably interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience curled herself in the deep window-seat,
quite sure that she had found a treasure. The book had
a furtive and apologetic air. “I have grown old, at
least,” it seemed to say. “I am but an elderly rake,
and can only mumble of the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She read a few stories, then put the book back in its
place with a resentful shove. Being wholly without the
knowledge for which Eve pined, the stories were stupid
and meaningless to her. She took down a thick volume
bound in ragged calf. On the back was one large word,
“Byron.” The leaves of this book were spotted too,
but on the leaves were poems, and she loved poetry.
Even when it was uninteresting she enjoyed the rhythm.
She returned to the window-seat, and child-like, looked
at the pictures first. The portrait of Byron she fell in
love with immediately, and knocking her composite off
its pedestal, lifted that proud passionate face to the
station of honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an immense-eyed picture of the Bride of
Abydos which she thought looked like Rosita, and one
of the Corsair dashing in upon his segregated love:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“My own Medora, sure thy song is sad!”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Francesca and Paola gazed at each other across a
table:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“That day no further leaf we did uncover.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A castle which looked older than the book loomed
massively from the page:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Lake Leman lies by Chillon’s walls.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Never having heard of Byron, she was unable to
enlarge her knowledge at once with his most celebrated
creations; but she liked the looks of Conrad and Medora,
and plunged into their fortunes. She read every line
of the poem, and when she had finished she read it
over again. Then she stared at the breakers booming
to the rocks on the opposite horn of the crescent, her
eyes expanded and filled with a wholly new light. She
might be unlettered in woman’s wisdom, but the transcendent
passion, the pounding vitality of the poet,
carried straight to intuition. The insidious elixir drifted
into the crystal stream. That incomparable objectivity
sang the song of songs as distinctly into her brain as
had it gathered the sounds of life for twenty years.
Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright. She
felt as if she were a musical instrument upon which
some divine unknown music were vibrating; and as
she was wont to feel in the tower—but with a substratum
of something quite different. She was filled
with a soft tumult which she did not in the least comprehend,
and happy. She looked almost beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she read “The Bride of Abydos,” and
dreamed over that until she discovered that she was
hungry. She had forgotten to order dinner, and went
to the kitchen to beg a crust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lola, large, unwhaleboned, vibrating porcinely with
every motion, her brown coarsely moulded face beaming
with good nature, her little black eyes full of
temper and kindness, her black hair in a neat small
knot, an unspotted brown and yellow calico garment
secluding her person, stood at a sink in a kitchen as
brilliantly clean as a varnished boot. Even the corners
shone like glass, Patience often observed with a sigh.
The two tables were scrubbed daily. The stove was
black, the windows white. Not a pan nor a dish save
those in the sink was in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience made a sudden dash, a leap, and alighted
on Lola’s back, encircling the yielding waist with her
supple legs. The woman emitted a hoarse shriek, then
laughed and pinched the legs. Patience plunged her
cold hands into the creases of Lola’s neck, gathering a
quantity into the palms. She was unrebuked. There
were a few persons that loved Patience, and Lola was
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pobrecita!</span>” she exclaimed. “You are cold, no?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mucho frizo</span>,” murmured Patience, sliding the back
of her hands down the mountainous surface of Lola’s.
“And hungry, <span class='it'>madre de dios</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hungry? You no have the dinner? When you
coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hours ago, Lola. How cruel of you not to call me to
dinner! How mean and piggish to eat it all yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, no call me the names. How I can know you
are here <span class='it'>si</span> you no tell? Why you no coming here
straight before going to the <span class='it'>librario</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot, Lola <span class='it'>mia</span>; and then I became—interested.
But do give me something to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si.</span>” And with Patience still on her back Lola
waddled to the cupboard and lifted down the remains
of a corn cake rolled about olives and cheese and
peppers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An <span class='it'>enchilada</span>!” said Patience. “Good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lola warmed the compound, and spread a napkin
on a corner of one of the tables; then, suddenly
unloosening Patience’s arms and legs, tumbled her
headlong into a chair, laughing sluggishly as she
ambled off. Patience ate the steaming <span class='it'>enchilada</span> as
heartily as had Byron never been. In a moment she
begged for a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si</span>,” said Lola, “I have some scrape already;” and
she brewed chocolate in a little earthen pot, then beat
it to froth with her <span class='it'>molinillo</span>. Patience kicked her
heels together with delight, and sipped it daintily while
Lola stood by with fat hands on fat hips in reflex
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it, <span class='it'>niña</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet.” Then after a moment she asked
dreamily: “Lola, were you ever in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Que!</span> Sure. Was I not marry? Poor my Pedro!
How he lika the <span class='it'>enchilada</span> and the chocolaty; and
the lard cakes and the little pig cooking with onions.
And now the worms eating him. Ay, yi!” and Lola sat
herself upon a chair and wept.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As Patience walked home through the woods subsequently
to a long afternoon with Byron, she was hazily
sensible that she had stepped from one phase of girlhood
into another. She had an odd consciousness of
gazing through a veil of gauze upon an exquisite but
unfamiliar landscape over which was a dazzle of sunlight.
She by no means understood the mystery of her
nature as yet; she was technically too ignorant; but
instinct was awake, and she felt somewhat as when she
had drained the poppy cup for long. She was in that
transition state when for the first and last time passion
is poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She arrived home in time to get supper. Mrs.
Sparhawk was unexpectedly sober, and very cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My land, Patience Sparhawk!” she exclaimed, as
her daughter opened the door and untied her sunbonnet,
“seems to me you might help cook dinner in
vacation instead of being off all day reading books or
playing with that Spanish girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” said Patience, restored to her
practical self, “that as you’re twice as big as I am and
twice as strong, you’re pretty well able to get it yourself.
And as it’s your fault there ain’t any servant in
this house, I don’t see why I should make one of
myself for you. Seems to me you’re fixed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sparhawk blushed, and smoothed her hair consciously.
The hair had been washed, and was decorated
with a red bow. She wore a garment of turkey
red calico with a bit of cheap lace at the throat and
wrists. Her face was plastered with a whitewash much
in vogue. She looked handsome, but evil, and Patience
stared at her with an uneasiness she was not able to
analyse. She turned away after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d put on an apron,” she remarked drily. “You
might get spots on that gorgeous window curtain dress
of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the man Oscar entered the room.
He uttered a note of admiration which made Patience
turn about sharply. He was gazing upon Mrs. Sparhawk’s
enhanced charms with an expression which
Patience did not understand, but which filled her
with sudden fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” she exclaimed roughly, “go into the
dining room until supper’s ready. This kitchen ain’t
big enough for three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man moved his eyes and regarded her
angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s boss here?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not your place to ask questions. You’re
hired to work outside, and when you come into this
house there’s only one place for you. Now go into
the other room.” Her eyes were flashing, and she
had drawn up her shoulders. The man backed away
from her much as dogs do when cats give warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That girl gives me a chill. I hate her,” he muttered
to his mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sparhawk gave a loud laugh which covered her
embarrassment, and slapped him heartily on the shoulder.
“Go in, go in,” she said. “What’s the use of
family quarrels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man slunk away, and Patience went about her
work with vicious energy. She fried liver and baked
biscuits while her mother stirred the steaming cherries
and brewed tea. When supper was ready she filled
Oscar’s plate first and served him last, not hating herself
in the least for her spite and spleen. After Mrs.
Sparhawk had taken her place at the head of the table
even her exuberant beauty could not dispel the frown
on the hired man’s brow, until, to Patience’s disgust, she
divined the cause of his surliness, and deftly exchanged
her plate for his.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>That night Patience did not go to her tower, but
wandered over the dark fields, a drooping forlorn
little figure in the crawling shadows. She felt dull
and tired and disheartened. By nine o’clock she
was asleep. She awoke as fresh as the morning.
When Mr. Foord returned from San Francisco in the
afternoon he found her curled in the easy-chair by
his fire. She started guiltily as he entered, then
tossed her head defiantly, let Byron slide to the floor,
and went forward to kiss him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he was about to take the chair she had occupied
he espied the fallen volume. He lifted it hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience blushed furiously, but set her lips with
an expression he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Byron, and I’m going to read it all. I’ve
read a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shifted the book from one hand to the other
for a moment, his face much perturbed. Finally he
laid it on the table, merely remarking: “Sooner or
later, sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience offered him a piece of the candy he had
brought her; but he preferred his pipe, and she perched
herself on the arm of his chair and ate half the contents
of her box without pause. She had not yet
learned the subtle delights of the epicure, and to enjoy
until capacity was exhausted was typical of her enthusiastic
temperament. When she could no longer look
upon the candy without a shudder she climbed to the
old gentleman’s shoulder and scratched his bald pate
with her ragged nails. It was her emphatic way of
expressing gratitude, and beloved by Mr. Foord above
pipe and <span class='it'>enchilada</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience took Byron home with her that evening,
Mr. Foord merely shrugging his shoulders. After
supper she read until dark, then hid the book under
the bed and went over to the tower. She ran up
the twisted stair, and astonished the owl by clasping
him in her arms and kissing him passionately. He
manifested his disapproval by biting at her shoulder
fiercely. She shrieked and boxed his ears smartly.
He flapped his large wings wildly. A battle royal was
imminent in that sacred tower where once the silver
bells had called the holy men to prayer. But Patience
suddenly broke into a laugh and sank on her knees
by the window, while Solomon retreated to the wall,
and regarded her with a round unwinking stare, brooding
over problems which he did not in the least
understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience brooded also, but her lids drooped, and
she barely saw the beauty of ocean and rock and
spray. The moon was not yet up, and the half revealed
intoning sea was full of mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was conscious that her mood was not quite what
it had been during her last visit. All of that was
there—but more. She felt higher above the earth
than ever before, but more conscious of its magnetism.
Something hummed along her nerves and stirred in
her veins. Her musings shaped to definite form,
inasmuch as they assumed the semblance of man.
Inevitably Byron was exhumed for duty; and if his
restless soul were prowling space and Carmel Valley,
his famous humour, desuetous in Eternity, must have
echoed in the dull ears of roaming shapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside the white face of the child was the solemn
and hebraic visage of the owl. Some outworn chord
of Solomon’s youth may have been stirred by his
friend’s tumultuous greeting, for he had stepped, with
the dignity of his years, to her side, and stood regarding,
with introspective stare, the reflection of the rising
moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience did not see him. She was gazing upon
Byron, whose moody passionate face was distinctly
visible among the stars. Alas! her vision was suddenly
obscured by a hideous black object. A bat flew
straight at Carmel tower. Patience sprang to her feet,
tossed her skirt over her head, and fled down the stair.
The owl stepped to the stair’s head and gazed into the
winding darkness, his eyes full of unutterable nothing.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On Monday school re-opened, and Patience was late
as usual. She loitered through the woods, conning
her lessons, having been too much occupied with her
poet to give them attention before. As she ascended
the steps of the schoolhouse the drone of the Lord’s
Prayer came through the open window, and she paused
for a moment on the landing, swinging her bag in one
hand and her tin lunch-pail in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not a picturesque figure. Her sunbonnet
was of faded blue calico dotted with white. The
meagre braid projecting beneath the cape was tied
with a shoe string. The calico frock was faded and
mended and much too short, although the hem and
tucks had been let out. The copper-toed boots were
of a greyish-green hue, and the coarse stockings
wrinkled above them. The nails of her pretty brown
hands looked as if they had been sawed off. But the
eyes under the old sunbonnet were dreamy and happy.
The brain behind was full of new sensations. In the
sparkling atmosphere was an electric thrill. The day
was as still as only the days of Monterey can be.
The pines, and the breakers had never intoned more
sweetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voluminous A—men! startled Patience from her
reverie. She went hastily within, hung her bonnet
and pail on a peg, and entered the schoolroom, smiling
half deprecatingly half confidently, at Miss Galpin.
The young teacher’s stern nod did not discompose her.
As she passed Rosita she received a friendly pinch,
and Manuela looked up and smiled; but while traversing
the width of the room to her desk she became
aware of something unfriendly in the atmosphere. As
she took her seat she glanced about and met the
malevolent eyes of a dozen turned heads. One girl’s
lip was curled; another’s brows were raised significantly,
as would their owner query: “What could
you expect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience blushed until her face glowed like one of
the Castilian roses on the garden wall opposite the
window. “They’ve found out about Byron,” she
thought. “Horrors, how they’ll tease me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>School girls have a traditional habit of “willing” each
other to “miss” when in aggressive mood. To-day
some twenty of the girls appeared to have concerted to
will that Patience should forget what little lore she had
gathered on her way to school. Patience, always sensitive
to impressions, was as taut as the strings of
an Æolian harp from her experience of the past week.
Such natures are responsive to the core to the psychological
power of the environment, and once or twice
this morning Patience felt as if she must jump to her
feet and scream. But even at that early age she divined
that the sweetest revenge is success, and she
strove as she had never striven before to acquit herself
with credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All morning the silent battle went on. Miss Galpin,
who was beloved of her pupils because she was pretty
and dressed well, was a graduate of the San Francisco
High School, and an excellent teacher. Frankly
as she liked Patience she had never shown her any
partiality in the schoolroom; but to-day, noting the
antagonism that was brought to bear on the girl, she
exerted all her cleverness to assist her in such subtle
fashion that Patience alone should appreciate her effort.
In consequence, when the morning session
closed, Patience wore the doubtful laurels and the bad
blood was black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the girls trooped down into the yard Rosita laid
her arm about Patience and endeavoured to lead her
away. Manuela conferred in a low tone with the foe,
voice and gestures remonstrant. But there was blood
in the air, and Patience squared her shoulders and
awaited the onslaught. Incidentally she inspected her
nails and copper toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the girls walked rapidly up to her. They
were smiling disagreeably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you keep her at home?” asked one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think she’ll marry him?” demanded another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, completely taken aback, glanced helplessly
from one to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Patita,” murmured Rosita, on the verge
of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuela exclaimed: “You are fiends, <span class='it'>fiends</span>!” and
walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean? Do you mean to say she got off without
you knowing it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knowing what?” A horrible presentiment assailed
Patience. Her fingers jerked and her breath
came fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said Panchita McPherson, brutally, “your
mother was in here Saturday night with her young man
and regularly turned the town upside down. They
were thrown out of three saloons. Can’t you keep her
at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stared dully at the girls, her dry lips parted.
She knew that they had spoken the truth. She had
gone to bed early on Saturday night. Shortly afterward
she had heard the sound of buggy wheels and
Billy’s uncertain gait. Many hours later she had been
awakened by the sound of her mother stumbling upstairs;
but she had thought nothing of either incident
at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Panchita continued relentlessly, memories of many
class defeats rushing forward to lash her spleen: “You’ll
please understand after this that we don’t care to have
you talk to us, for we don’t think you’re respectable.”
Whereupon the other girls, nodding sarcastically at
Patience, entwined their arms and walked away, led
by the haughty Miss McPherson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments Patience hardly realised how she
felt. She stood impassive; but a cyclone raged within.
All the blood in her body seemed to have rushed to
her head, to scorch her face and pound in her ears.
She wondered why her hands and feet were cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Patita, don’t mind them,” said Rosita, putting
her arm round her comrade. “The mean hateful
nasty—<span class='it'>pigs!</span>” Never before had the indolent little
Californian been so vehement; but Patience slipped
from her hold, and running through a gate at the back
of the yard crouched down on a box. Rosita’s words
had broken the spell. She was filled with a volcano
of hate. She hated the girls, she hated Monterey,
she hated life; but above all she hated her
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time all the hate in her concentrated on the
woman who had made her young life so bitter. She
had never liked her, but not until the dreadful moments
just past had she realised the full measure of her
inheritance. The innuendoes she had not understood,
but it was enough to know that her mother had disgraced
her publicly and insulted her father’s memory.
Her schoolmates she dismissed from her mind with a
scornful jerk of the shoulders. She had beaten them
too easily and often in the schoolroom not to despise
them consummately. They could prick but not stab
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell rang; but she had an account to settle, and
bonnetless she started for home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sparhawk was sitting on the porch reading a
novel when Patience walked up to her, snatched the
book from her hand, and flung it into a rose-tree.
The woman was sober, and quailed as she met her
daughter’s eyes. Patience had walked rapidly under
a hot sun. Her face was scarlet, and she was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate you!” she sobbed. “I hate you! It
doesn’t do any good to tell you so, but it does me
good to say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked the incarnation of evil passions.
She was elemental Hate, a young Cain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you were dead,” she continued. “You’ve
ruined every bit of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—what—what—” mumbled the woman.
But the colour was coming to her face, and her eyes
were beginning to glitter unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know well enough what. You were in town
drunk on Saturday night, and were in saloons <span class='it'>with a
farm hand</span>. To make a brute of yourself was bad
enough—but to go about with a common man! Are
you going to marry him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sparhawk laughed. “Well, I guess not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience drew a quick breath of relief. “Well,
that’s what they’re saying—that you’re going to
marry him—a man that can’t read nor write. Now
look here, I want one thing understood—unless you
swear to me you’ll not set foot in that town again
I’ll have you put in the Home of the Inebriates—There!
I’ll not be disgraced again; I’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sparhawk sprang to her feet, her face blazing
with rage. “You will, will you?” she cried. She
caught the girl by the shoulders, and shaking her violently,
boxed first one ear, then the other, with her strong
rough hands. For an instant Patience was stunned,
then the blood boiled back to her brain. She screamed
harshly, and springing at her mother clutched her about
the throat. The lust to kill possessed her. A red curtain
blotted even the hated face from sight. Instinctively
she tripped her mother and went down on top
of her. The crash of the body brought two men to the
rescue, and Patience was dragged off and flung aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My land!” exclaimed one of the men, his face
white with horror. “Was you going to kill your ma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that she was,” spluttered Mrs. Sparhawk,
sitting up and pulling vaguely at the loose flesh of
her throat. “She’d have murdered me in another
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience by this time was white and limp. She
crawled upstairs to her room and locked the door.
She sank on the floor and thought on herself with
horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew,” she reiterated, “that I was so bad.
Why, I’m fifteen, and I never wanted to kill even a bird
before. I wouldn’t learn to shoot. I’d never drown
a kitten. When the Chinaman stuck a red-hot poker
through the bars of the trap and burnt ridges in the
live rat I screamed and screamed. And now I’ve
nearly killed my mother, and wanted to. Who, who
would have thought it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was wearied with the futile effort to solve
the new problem, she became suddenly conscious that
she felt no repentance, no remorse. She was horrified
at the sight of the black veins in her soul; but she felt
a certain satisfaction at having unbottled the wrath that
consumed her, at having given her mother the physical
equivalent of her own mental agony. Over this last
cognisance of her capacity for sin she sighed and shook
her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well give myself up,” she thought with
young philosophy. “I am what I am, and I suppose
I’ll do what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went downstairs and out of the house. She
passed a group of men; they stared at her in horror.
Then another little seed from the vast garden of human
nature shot up to flower in Patience’s puzzled brain.
She lifted her head with an odd feeling of elation: she
was the sensation of the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went out on Point Lobos and listened to the
hungry roar of the waves, watched the tossing spray.
Nature took her to her heart as ever, and when the
day was done she was normal once more. She returned
to the house and helped to get supper, although she
refused to speak to her equally sullen parent.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was several days before the story reached Monterey.
When it did, the girls treated Patience to invective
and contumely, but delivered their remarks at
long range. The mother of Manuela said peremptorily
that Patience Sparhawk should never darken the doors
of the Peralta mansion again, and even Mrs. Thrailkill
told the weeping Rosita that the intimacy must end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin was horrified. When school was over
she took Patience firmly by the hand and led her up
the hill to her boarding-place, the widow Thrailkill’s
ancestral home. The long low adobe house was traversed
from end to end by a pillared corridor. It was
whitewashed every year, and its red tiles were renewed
at intervals, but otherwise the march of civilisation had
passed it by. Mrs. Thrailkill, large and brown, with a
wart between her kind black eyes, and a handsome
beard, was rocking herself on the corridor. When she
recognised the teacher’s companion she arose with great
dignity and swung herself into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin led Patience down the corridor to a
room at the end, and motioned her to a chair. Several
magazines lay on a table, and Patience reached her
hand to them involuntarily; but Miss Galpin took the
hand and drew the girl toward her. The young
teacher’s brown eyes wore a very puzzled expression.
Even her carefully regulated bang had been pushed upward
with a sudden dash of the hand. She was only
twenty-two, and her experience of human nature was
limited. Her ideas of life were accumulated largely
from the novels of Mr. Howells and Mr. James, whom
she revered; and neither of these gentlemen photographed
such characters as Patience. It had probably
never occurred to them that Patiences existed. She
experienced a sudden thrill of superiority, then craved
pardon of her idols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, dear,” she said gently, “is this terrible
story true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am,” said Patience, standing passively at
Miss Galpin’s knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You actually tried to kill your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin gasped. She waited a moment for a
torrent of excuse and explanation; but Patience was
mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are not sorry?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patience!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry you feel so badly, ma’am. Please don’t
cry,” for the estimable young woman was in tears, and
mentally reviling her preceptors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I help feeling terribly, Patience? You
break my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, dear Miss Galpin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, don’t you love God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, not particularly. Leastways, I’ve
never thought much about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little heathen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, I’m not. My father was very religious.
But please don’t talk religion to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, I don’t know what to make of you. I
am in despair. You’re not a bad girl. You give me
little trouble, and I’ve always said that you had finer
impulses than any girl I’ve ever known, and the best
brain. You ought to realise better than any girl of
your age the difference between right and wrong. And
yet you have done what not another girl in the school
would do, inferior as they are—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know, ma’am? I never thought I
would. Neither did you think I would. You can’t
tell what you’ll do till you do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin was distracted. She resumed hurriedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to be a good woman, Patience,—a good
as well as a clever woman. And how can you be good
if you don’t love God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are all people good the same way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it all comes to the same thing in the end.”
Miss Galpin blessed the evolution of verbiage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are all religious people good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These girls are religious, especially the Spanish
ones, and they’ve behaved to me like devils. So have
their mothers, and some of them go to five o’clock
mass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls are undisciplined, and mothers often have a
mistaken sense of duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are good, and Mr. Foord is good,” pursued
the terrible child. “But you’d be just as good if you
weren’t religious. It’s born in you, and you’re refined
and kind-hearted. Those people are just naturally vulgar,
and religion won’t make them any better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin drew the girl suddenly to her lap and
kissed her. “I’m terribly sorry for you, dear,” she
said. “I wish I understood you better, and could help
you, but I don’t. I never knew any one in the least
like you. I worry so about your future. People that
are not like other people don’t get along nicely in this
world. And you have such impulses! But I love you,
Patience, and I’ll always be your friend. Will you remember
this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was undemonstrative, but she kissed Miss
Galpin warmly and arranged her bang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, let’s talk about something else,” she said.
“Are you going to get up those private theatricals for
the night that school closes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin sighed and gave up the engagement.
“Yes,” she said. Then, hesitatingly: “Do you wish
to take part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course I don’t. I’ll have nothing more to
do with those girls than I can help. You can bet your
life on that. But I can help drill Rosita. What’s the
play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll read it to you.” Miss Galpin took a pamphlet
from a drawer and read aloud the average amateur concoction.
Rosita was to take the part of an indolent
girl with the habit of arousing herself unexpectedly.
In one act she would have to dash to the front of the
stage and dance a parlour breakdown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid Rosita cannot act,” said Miss Galpin,
in conclusion, “but she is so pretty I couldn’t leave
her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosita can act,” said Patience, emphatically. “I’ve
seen her imitate every actress that has been here, and
take off pretty nearly every crank in Monterey. And
Mrs. Thrailkill can teach her one of the old Californian
dances—and a song. Rosita has a lovely voice,
almost as pretty as a lark’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? Well, I’ll talk to Mrs. Thrailkill and persuade
her to forgive you, and then you can come here
every afternoon and drill Rosita. And now will you
promise me to be a good little girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am—leastways I’ll try. Good-bye,” and
Patience gave her a little peck, seized her sunbonnet,
and went hurriedly out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” she thought as she sauntered down the
hill, “I’d better go and have it out with Mr. Foord.
It’s got to come, and the sooner it’s over the better.
Poor man, I’ll make it as easy for him as I can. It’ll
be harder on him than on me, for I’m used to it
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman was walking up and down the
corridor as she turned the corner of the custom house.
He looked very yellow and feeble, and supported himself
with a stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patience!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time Patience felt inclined to cry, but
her aversion to display feeling controlled her. She
merely approached and stood before him, swinging her
sunbonnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let us talk about it,” he said hastily. “I
have something else to say to you. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down side by side on a bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” the old gentleman continued, “I have
a half-sister in the east—Harriet Tremont, her name
is—in Mariaville-on-Hudson, New York. She is the
best woman in the world, the most sinless creature I
ever knew, yet full of human nature and never dull.
She is very religious, has given up her life to doing
good, and has some eccentric notions of her own. She
writes me dutifully twice a year, although we have not
met for thirty, and in her last letter she told me she
intended to adopt a child, rescue a soul as she called it,
and furthermore that she should adopt the child of the
most worthless parents she could discover in her work
among the worthless. Since—lately—I have been
thinking strongly of sending you to her. You must get
away from here. You must have a chance in life. If
you remain here you will grow up bitter and hard, and
the result with your brain and temperament may be
terrible. You are capable of becoming a very bad or
a very good woman. You are still young—but there
is no time to lose. Should you care to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I should,” cried Patience, enchanted
with the idea of an excursion into unknown worlds.
Then her face fell. “But I shouldn’t like to be
adopted. That is too much like charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the ranch entirely mortgaged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let us look at it as a business proposition.
You will be little expense to her—she is fairly well off;
and one more in the household makes no appreciable
difference. You will attend the public schools with the
view to become a teacher, and when you are earning
a salary you can repay her for what little outlay she
may have made. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t mind if you look at it that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see your mother in a day or two. You don’t
think she’ll object, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Object? What has she got to say about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great deal, unfortunately. She is your legal
guardian. But she doesn’t love you, and I think can
be persuaded. I shall miss you, my dear. What shall
I do without my bright little girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience nestled up to him, and the two strangely
assorted companions remained silent for a time watching
the seagulls sweep over the blue bay. Then Mr.
Foord drifted naturally into the past, and Patience grew
romantic once more.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>That night Patience felt no inclination for either bed
or tower. She wandered over the field, entered the
pine forest, and walked to the coast. The tall straight
trees grew close together; their aisles were very
gloomy. From the ground arose the ominous voices
of the night, and the wind in the treetops moaned
heavily. But Patience was not afraid. She revelled in
the vast dark silence, and felt that the world was all her
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she left the forest she saw great clouds of spray
tossed high into the starry dark, heard the ocean rush
at the outlying rocks, breaking into mist or leaping to
the shore. The sea lions were talking loudly; the seagulls,
huddled on the high points of the coast, scolded
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the edge of the forest was a cabin. Patience
walked toward it. She knew the old man that lived
there. He was evidently awake, for the open window
was yellow with light. As she passed it on her way to
the door she glanced within. Her skin turned cold;
her hair stiffened. A sheeted corpse lay on the bed.
Candles burned at head and foot. Patience, brave
as she was, abjectly feared the corpse. She believed
that she could survive a ghost, but she knew that if shut
up with a dead body for ten minutes she should go
mad. To-night she would have fled shrieking were it
not that the room had a living occupant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a chair beside the bed sat a man gazing at the
floor, his chin dropped to his chest. He wore rough
clothes, but they were the affectations of the gentleman,
not the garb of the dead man and his friends. Nor
had Patience ever seen so noble a head. The profile
was beautiful, the expression mild and intellectual, and
most melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience forgot her terror as she wondered who the
stranger could be; but in a moment it was renewed
tenfold. Down the ocean road from Monterey came
a wild hideous yell. The man by the corpse raised his
head apprehensively, rose as if to flee, then sank
wearily to his chair again. The clatter of hoofs on the
hard road mounted above the thunder of the waves.
Patience staring into the dark suddenly saw the leaping
fire of torches, and a moment later tall figures riding
recklessly. The yelling was incessant and demoniac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man murdered Jim and they’re lynchers,”
thought Patience. She glanced about wildly. A small
tree stood near. She scampered up the trunk like
a squirrel, and hid in the branches. None too soon.
In another moment those terrible figures were screaming
and gesticulating before the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smoky flames revealed an extraordinary sight to
Patience’s distended eyes. These men were bearded
like the men of modern civilisation, even their hair was
properly cut; but they wore the garments of Greece
and Japan, flowing robes of white and red; one dark
sinister-looking being upheld a glittering helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience rubbed her eyes. Did she dream over her
Byron? But no mortal, none but the sheeted dead,
could have slept and dreamed in that infernal clamour.
Only the man by the bed sat immobile. He did not
raise his head. Out of the pandemonium of sound
Patience at last distinguished one word: “Charley!
Charley!” If “Charley” were the man within the
hut he gave no sign; nor when they threw back their
heads and as from one throat gave forth a rattling
volume of ribald laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Patience, who, seeing no rope, began to
recover her courage, noticed that one of the men had
ridden beneath her tree, taking no part in this singular
drama. Once he turned his head, and an aquiline
profile, fine and strong, with black hair falling above
it, was sharply revealed against the red glare. Impulsively
Patience leaned down and touched his
shoulder. He looked up with a start, and saw a small
white face among the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth is this?” he asked. “Is it a
child?” His voice was rich and deep, with a gentle
hint of brogue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they?” asked Patience. “Are they real
devils, or only men? And are they going to kill him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laughed. “I certainly should ask the same
question if I had not happened to come with them.
Oh, they won’t do any murder, unless they happen to
frighten some one to death. They’re members of the
Bohemian Club of San Francisco—newspaper men and
artists—who are down here on a lark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s the man in there by him, and why do they
yell at him so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he is a solitary spirit, a man of genius. He
got tired of them and gave them the slip to-night.
This is revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have the Estrada house on Alvarado Street,”
said Patience. “I heard they were here.” Then she
noticed that her companion wore the common garb of
American civilisation. “Why aren’t you rigged up,
too?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m hardly one of them. I’m only an Eastern
man—a New Yorker—and am staying at Del Monte for
a day or two. I rode over to see them this afternoon, and
they insisted upon my staying for dinner. What on earth
are you doing here by yourself at this time of night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience explained. Then she added wistfully, “I
shall be frightened to death going home through those
woods alone. I’ll imagine that that corpse and those
dreadful-looking men are behind me at every step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just drop onto my horse and I’ll take you home.
I’m pretty tired of all this.” He raised his arms and
lifted her down, placing her in front of him. “Lucky
I had an English saddle,” he said, and as he bent his
head Patience could see that he was smiling. “Oh!”
he added abruptly, “I have seen you before. Now—tell
me where to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience directed him, and they cantered away unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you see me?” she asked, “and how
odd that you should remember <span class='it'>me</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have wonderful eyes. Although I’m an Irishman
I won’t go so far as to say they are pretty, but
they look as if they had been born to see so much. It
would be difficult to forget them. Upon me soul you
are actually trembling. Did you never have a compliment
before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! And I guess I’ll remember it longer than
you remember my eyes. Where did you see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was standing at the window of the house in Alvarado
Street when you came along from school with a
dozen or more of the girls. You all stopped to gaze at
a passing circus troupe, and—I noticed you first because
you stood a little apart from the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I usually do,” said Patience, drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not add that, attracted by the eagerness of
her gaze and her rapid changes of expression, he had
asked who she was, and that a Montereño present had
related the family history and her own notable performances
in no measured terms. “She’s got bad
blood in her and the temper of Old Nick himself.
She’ll come to no good, homely as she is,” the man
had concluded. “Curious enough, the boys all like
her and would spark her if they got a show; but she’s
hell-set on gettin’ an education at present and doesn’t
notice them much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience made him talk on for the pleasure of hearing
his voice. “Are you a real Irishman?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve been an American for twenty years, but
there’s a good deal of Irish left in me yet, especially in
me tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d keep it, if I were you. It’s nicer even than
the Spanish. Do you think our voices are horrid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that if you’d pitch yours a little lower it
would be an improvement,” he said, smiling. And
Patience registered a vow which she kept. In after
years when great changes had come upon her, her voice
was envied and emulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left the forest and entered Carmel Valley
Patience pointed to her home, then suddenly took the
reins from his hand and directed the horse toward the
Mission. The waning moon hung over the ocean, and
the Mission stood out boldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up to my tower,” said Patience; “the view
is <span class='it'>something</span>! That will be your reward. I never took
any one there before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said, “I may as well make a night of
it.” He tethered his horse and followed her up the
spiral stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Solomon is not here,” she said regretfully. “He’s
out foraging. Now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man walked to the window and inspected
the view. Patience regarded him with rapt admiration.
He was tall and strong and well dressed. She had
never dreamed that anything romantic could really
happen to her; and as she was sure that it would be her
last experience as well as her first, she suddenly felt
depressed and miserable, her imagination leaping to
the finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and met her eyes. “What are you thinking
of?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience was too shy to tell him, and asked him
if he liked the view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a jolly view and no mistake. You’re not a
happy child, are you?” he added, abruptly. With the
enthusiasm and spontaneous kindness of his Irish blood
he had conceived the idea of dropping a seed in this
plastic soil, and was feeling his way toward the right
spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that I am,” said Patience, haughtily.
“I suppose some of those people told you things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they did, that’s a fact. But you mustn’t get
angry with me, please, for upon me word I like you
better than any one I’ve met in California.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My home is in New York, and I return to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Well, I don’t see how I should interest you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do, though, and that’s all there is to it. I’m
neither as cautious as an Englishman nor as practical
as an American—though God rest the two of them; I
mean nothing to their detriment. But there’s a force
in you, and force doesn’t go to waste, although it’s
more often than not misdirected. I can feel yours
myself; and I’m told that you’re the cleverest girl in
the town as well as the proudest and most ambitious.
Now, what do you intend to do with yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’ll be a teacher; and if Mrs. Sparhawk
has no objections I may go East soon and live with a
religious old lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s not so bad; only I doubt if that life
will suit you any better than this.” He put his finger
under her chin and turned her face to the light. “I
am a lawyer, you know,” he added, “and features and
lines and curves mean a good deal to me. You’ve
got a good will, begad, and like all first-class American
women, you’ll keep your head up until you drop. And
you have all her faculty of beginning life over again
several times, if necessary. You’ll never rust nor mould,
nor write polemical novels if things don’t go your way.
You’ve got a good strong brain behind those eyes, and
although you’ll make mistakes of various sorts, you’ll
kick them behind you when you’re done with them,
begin over and be none the worse. Remember that
no mistake is irrevocable; that there are as many
to-morrows as yesterdays; that only the incapable has
a past. It is all a matter of will as far as the world is
concerned, and ideals as far as your own soul goes.
No matter how often circumstances and your own
weakness compel you to let go your own private ideals,
deliberately put them back on their pedestal the moment
you have recovered balance, and make for their attainment
as if nothing had happened. Then you’ll never
acquire an aged soul and never lose your grip. Can
you remember all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “I believe you. I might add: Don’t
love the wrong man, but I’ll not throw away good
advice. You’ll not be wholly guided by reason in
those matters. I will merely say, Rub the first experience
in hard and let a long while elapse before your
second, or it will be the greater mistake of the two.
Your reactions will be very violent, I should say. Well,
I’ll be going now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather you’d stay and talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you? Well, being a lawyer, I know where
to stop. Besides, I’ll have all those fellows after me if
I stay too long. We’ll doubtless meet again. The
world is small these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience followed him reluctantly down the stair, and
he walked beside her across the valley, leading his
horse. When they reached the farmhouse he shook
hands with her warmly, wished her good luck, and rode
away. She ran up to her room, and, lighting a candle,
transcribed his words into an old copybook.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin expostulated with Mrs. Thrailkill to such
effect that Patience spent two hours each afternoon in
the family garret rehearsing Rosita while the astonished
rats took refuge in the chimney. Patience could not
act, but she had dramatic appreciation and an intellectual
conception of any part not beyond her years.
Rosita was not intellectual, but, as Patience had discerned,
the spirit of Thalia was in her. She quickly
became enamoured of her unsuspected resources and
at the prospect of exhibiting herself on a platform. Not
only did she rouse herself to something like exertion,
but she faithfully followed the instructions of her strenuous
teacher and discovered a talent for posing and
little tricks of manner all her own. Her mother taught
her the song and dance, which were to be the sensation
of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the fourth day that Patience, returning
home late in the afternoon, met Mr. Foord in the
woods. The old gentleman looked sad and perplexed,
and Patience sprang upon the step of his buggy and
demanded to know what was the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very odd,” he said, “but she won’t let you
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t let me go?” cried Patience, furiously. “Well,
I’ll go anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t, my dear. The law won’t let you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say that the law won’t protect me
from that woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid she has the best of it.” He recalled
the woman’s angry cunning face, as he had pleaded
with her, and shook his head. “You see she was never
in the town in that condition before. The men out
there are so devoted to her that—so she has informed
me—they would swear to a man that they had never
seen her drunk. And, you see, she’s never abused you—the
only time she struck you she had provocation—you
must admit that. You are under her control
until you are eighteen, and I don’t see that we can do
anything. I’m very sorry. I never felt so defeated in
my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for gracious goodness sake why won’t she let
me go? I’m no good to speak of about the place, and
she certainly isn’t keeping me for love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I think it’s revenge. She remarked that she
had a chance to pay up and she’d do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll just run away, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law would bring you back, and arrest me for
abduction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate the law,” said Patience, gloomily. “Seems
to me I’m always finding something new to hate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not hate, my child,” and he quoted the
Bible dutifully, although in entire sympathy with her.
“That is what I am so afraid of—that you will become
hard and bitter. I want to save you from that. Well,
perhaps she’ll relent. I shall see her again and again.
I must go on, Patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him and walked sullenly homeward. As
she entered the kitchen her mother looked up and
laughed. Her face was triumphant and malignant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t go,” she said. “Not much. I’ve got
the whip hand this time and I’ll keep it. Here you’ll
stay until you’re eighteen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience turned abruptly and ran upstairs. As she
locked her door she thought with some satisfaction:
“Now that I know myself I can control myself. If I’d
jumped on her then she’d have fallen in the stove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her imagination had not dwelt at great length
upon the proposed change the disappointment was not
as keen as it might have been, much as she desired to
leave Monterey. Moreover, she was occupied with
Rosita and the coming examinations. And did she
not have her Byron? She rose at dawn and read him.
In the evening she went over to the tower and declaimed
him to the grey ocean whose passions were
eternal. The owl, who regarded Byron as a great bore,
closed his eyes when she began and went to sleep.
Sometimes—when the sun rode high—she sat upon
the rubbish over Junipero Serra’s bones, and with one
eye out for rats and snakes and tarantulas, conned a
new poem. She liked the contrast between the desolation
and death in the old ruin and the warm atmosphere
of the poetry. As often Byron was unheeded, and she
dreamed of the mysterious stranger who had so magnetised
her that she had forgotten to ask his name. She
had only to close her eyes to hear his voice, to recall
the words which seemed forever moving in one or
other chamber of her mind, to see the profile which she
admired quite as much as Byron’s. As for the voice, it
had a possessing quality which made her understand
the wherefore of the thrilling notes of the male bird in
spring-time. She invested her ambitious young lawyer
with all the dark sardonic melancholic fascinations of
Lara, Conrad, Manfred, and Don Juan. The wild sweet
sting of spring was in her veins. Her mind was full of
vague illusions, very lovely and very strange, shifting of
outline and wholly inexplicable.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of the last day of school several
of the girls decorated the hall with garlands and flags.
Carpenters erected a stage, and Patience arranged the
“properties.” When the great night arrived and
Monterey in its best attire crowded the room, no curtain
in the sleepy town had ever been regarded with
more complacent expectation. The Montereñas were
thoroughly satisfied with their offspring, and performances
of any sort were few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The programme was opened by Manuela, who wore
an old pink satin frock of her mother’s cut short and
trimmed with a flounce of Spanish lace. Her brown
shining face looked good will upon all the world as she
recited “The Wreck of the Hesperus.” Then came a
dialogue in which all the little participants wore white
frocks and crimped hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, in the dressing-room, Rosita was limp in
Patience’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patita!” she gasped, “I can’t! I can’t!
I’m frightened to death! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do?” cried Patience, angrily, who was so excited
herself that she pumped Rosita’s arms up and down as
if the unfledged Thespian had just been rescued from
the bay. “Do? You must brace up. When you get
there you’ll be all right. And you <span class='it'>must not</span> get stage
fright. Rosita, you <span class='it'>must</span> make a success. Remember
you’ve got the star part. Don’t, <span class='it'>don’t</span> make a fool of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you could only hold my hand,” wailed
Rosita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t, and that’s the end of it. Now!
brace up quick.” The prompter was calling in a loud
whisper,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Thrailkill, be ready when I say, ‘Life.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ay, dios de mi alma</span>,” almost sobbed Rosita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience dragged her to the wings and held her
there. When the cue was spoken she gave her a hard
pinch, then a shove. Rosita gasped and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience slipped round into the audience, her heart
in her throat, her eyes black with excitement. If
Rosita broke down she felt that she should have
hysterics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Rosita had nothing to say. Upon entering
she had merely to fling herself upon a divan in an
indolent attitude whilst the others carried on a spirited
dialogue. Patience saw that she had managed to get
to the sofa without falling prone, but also observed
that her bosom was heaving. Nevertheless, when her
time came she managed to drawl her lines, although
with as little expression as she told her rosary.
Patience stamped her foot audibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the play progressed it was evident that Rosita
was recovering her poise. When she finally had to
come forward she moved with all the indolent grace of
her blood, and delivered her little speech with such
piquant fire that the audience applauded loudly. And
with that clatter of feet and hands a new light sprang
into the Spanish girl’s eyes, an expression half of surprise,
half of transport. From that time on she acted
in a manner which astonished even her instructor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked exquisitely pretty. Her white rounded
neck and arms were bare. Her black soft hair hung
to her knees, unbound, caught back above one little
ear with a pink rose. Her dress was of black Spanish
lace covered with natural roses. On her tiny feet she
wore a pair of black satin slippers which had belonged
to her grandmother and twinkled many a time to the
music of El Son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, upon being twitted with her indolence, she
suddenly sprang to the front of the stage, and after
singing an old Spanish love-song to the music of her
own guitar, danced El Son with all the rhythmic grace
of the beautiful women of the old gay time, she was no
longer an actress but an impersonator. The more the
delighted audience applauded the more poetically she
danced, the more significantly her long eyes flamed.
Once when the applause deafened she swayed as if intoxicated.
As the dance finished, her red lips were
parted. She was panting slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the curtain fell Patience rushed into the dressing-room
and embraced her rapturously. “Rosita!”
she cried, “you were simply, mag-<span class='it'>nif</span>-icent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita, who was trembling violently, hung about
Patience’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patita!” she gasped. “I was in heaven. I
never was so happy. You don’t know what it is to
have a hundred people thinking of nothing but you
and applauding as if they were mad. Oh, I’m going
to act, act, act forever! I never want to do anything
else. And isn’t my skin white? I wish I had two
necks and four arms.”</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning prizes were distributed. Patience
took most of them, but Rosita was still the sensation of
the hour, although she had not passed an examination.
At noon she had a luncheon party. She sat at the
head of her table in a white dotted Swiss frock and
Roman sash, and talked faster than she had ever talked
in her life before. Altogether she was by no means
the Rosita of twenty-four hours ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thrailkill had prepared a luncheon of old time
Spanish dishes, and hovered, large and brown and
placid, about a table loaded with chickens under
mounds of yellow rice, <span class='it'>tamales</span>, and <span class='it'>dulces</span>. Patience,
between Manuela and a young cousin of Rosita’s, was
not unhappy. Her prizes lay on the window seat, she
liked good things, and was infected with the gaiety of
the hour. True, she wore her old muslin frock and a
plaid sash made from an ancient gown of her mother’s,
and the rest of the girls looked like a bed of newly
blossomed flowers; but at fifteen the spirits rise high
above trifles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she started for home she was as light of heart
as her more favoured mates; but in the wood a dire
affliction smote her. One of her teeth began to ache.
She had seen her mother many times with head tied up
and distorted face, and had wondered scornfully how
any one could make a fuss about a mere tooth. Now,
however, when her own suddenly felt as if impaled on
a needle, she uttered a loud wail, and ran toward home
as fast as her legs could carry her. She found her
mother similarly afflicted, and a bottle of drops on the
kitchen table. Mrs. Sparhawk condescended to apply
the remedy, and the agony left as suddenly as it had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper Patience went over to her tower, and as
ever floated between Carmel Valley and the stars, enveloped
with warm ether, which swirled to towers and
turrets inhabited by a projection of herself which she
saw only as a lover. Unfortunately all this rapture was
enacted in a strong draught. Even Solomon uttered a
sound once or twice which resembled a sneeze. Again
Patience’s tooth was punctured by a red-hot needle.
Her castles vanished. She caught her cheek with her
hand, stumbled down the winding stair, and flew across
the valley, the needle developing into a screw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was quiet, the kitchen dark. She lit a
candle and searched frantically for the drops. They
were not to be found. Then it occurred to her that
her mother must have taken them to her room, and
she ran up the stair.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At dawn next morning Patience found herself on the
summit of the mountain behind the house. Her progress
thither had skimmed the surface of memory and
left no trace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sea was grey, the sky was grey. A grey mist
moved in the valley. Beyond, the wood on the hill
loomed in faint black outline. The birds in the trees,
the seagulls on the rocks, the very ocean itself, were
locked in the heavy sleep of early morning. Once,
from the tower of the Mission, came the plaintive hooting
of the owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time Patience plucked a number of stickers
from her stockings, and wiped blood from her torn
hands with a large leaf wet with dew. She clasped
her hands inertly about her knees and stared down
upon the ocean. Horror was in her sunken eyes.
The skin of her face looked faded and old. Her nose
and chin were as pinched as the features of the dead.
She did not look like the same child. Nor was she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes closed heavily, her head dropped. She
roused herself. She felt that she had no right to do
anything again so natural as to sleep. But suddenly
she toppled over and lay motionless; until the sun sent
its slanting rays under her eyelids. Then she stretched
herself lazily, rubbing her eyes, and smiling as children
do when waking. But the smile froze to a ghastly grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised herself stiffly and descended the mountain,
clinging to the brush, the stones rolling from
beneath her feet. She ran across the valley and
plunged into the pine woods, but did not linger in
those fragrant aisles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached the edge of the town she paused
and half turned back; but there was one thing she
dreaded more than to meet the people of Monterey,
and she went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She skirted the town and made her way toward the
Custom House by a roundabout path. She passed a
group of boys, and averted her head with a gesture of
loathing. One boy, a gallant admirer, ran after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience!” he cried, “wait a minute.” But
Patience took to her heels and never paused until she
reached the Custom House. The perplexed knight
stood still and whistled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he exclaimed to his jeering comrades, “I
always knew Patience Sparhawk was a crank, but this
lets <span class='it'>me</span> out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stood for a few moments on the rocks,
then went slowly to the library and opened the door.
Mr. Foord sat by the fire. He looked up with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it’s you,” he said. “I’m very proud of you.—Why,
what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, her eyes fixed on the floor, took a chair
opposite him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Patience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not look up. She could not. Finally she
moved her face from him and stared at the mantel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve left home,” she said. “I’d like to stay here
for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course you can stay here. I’ll tell Lola
to put a cot in her room. But what is the matter?
Has your mother been drinking again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she struck you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it, my dear child? You know that
you are always more than welcome here; but you
must have some excuse for leaving home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an excuse. I can’t tell it. Please don’t
say anything more about it. I don’t think she’ll send
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, perhaps you’ll tell me after a time.
Meanwhile make yourself at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was much puzzled, but reflected that Patience
was not like other children; and he knew Mrs. Sparhawk’s
commanding talent for making herself disagreeable.
Still, he was shocked at her appearance; and
as the day wore on and she would not meet his eye,
but sat staring at the floor, his uneasy mind glimpsed
ugly possibilities. At dinner she ate little and did not
raise her eyes from her plate, although she made a
few commonplace remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At four o’clock Billy, the buggy, and a farm hand
stopped before the Custom House. The man handed
a note to Lola, asking her to give it to Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note read:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>You come home—hear? If you don’t, I’ll see that
you do.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:17em;'><span class='sc'>M. Sparhawk.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience went out to the man, who still sat in the
buggy. “Tell her,” she said, looking at Billy, “that
I’m not going home,—not now nor at any other
time. Just make her understand that I mean it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared, but nodded and drove off.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight Patience was awakened by a frantic clamour
in the street. “Those dreadful Bohemians,” she
thought sleepily, then sat up with thumping heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say your name, <span class='it'>niña</span>, no?” said Lola, whose
sonorous slumbers had also been disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience slipped to the floor and looked through the
window. The moon flooded the old town. The ruined
fort on the hill had never looked more picturesque,
the pines above more calm. In the hollow near the
blue waters the white arms of Junipero Serra’s cross
seemed extended in benediction. The old adobes
were young for the hour. One might fancy Isabel
Herrara walking down from the long house on the
hill, her <span class='it'>reboso</span> fluttering in the night wind, old Pio
Pico, glittering with jewels, beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the wide street before the Custom House,
surrounded by a hooting mob, the refuse of the saloons,
was a cursing gesticulating woman. Her black hair
was unbound, her garment torn. She flung her fists in
the face of those that sought to hold her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience Sparhawk!” she shrieked. “Patience
Sparhawk! Come down here to your mother. Come
down here this minute. Come, I say,” and a volley of
oaths followed, greeted with a loud cackling laugh by
the rabble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience saw Mr. Foord, clad in his dressing-gown,
go forth. She flung on her clothes hastily and ran
down the stair. Her mother and Mr. Foord were in
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’ll come back,” Mrs. Sparhawk was saying.
“I’ll see to that. How do you like a row under your
windows? Well, I’ll come here every night unless she
comes home. You’ll put me in the Home of the
Inebriates, will you? Think she’ll like to have that
said of her mother when she’s grown up? Not
Patience Sparhawk. I know her weak point. She’s
as proud as hell, and I’m not afraid of going to any
Home of the Inebriates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience pushed open the door. “I’m going with
you,” she said. “Now get out of this house as fast as
you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patience,” exclaimed Mr. Foord. His old
cheeks were splashed with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry,” said Patience,
her hands clenching and quivering. “I didn’t think
she’d do this, or I wouldn’t have stayed. What a
return for all your kindness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience,” said the old gentleman, “promise me
that you will come to see me to-morrow. Promise, or
I shall not let you go. She can do her worst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ordered her mother to follow her out of the
back door that they might avoid the expectant mob.
Mrs. Sparhawk walked unsteadily, but received no assistance
from her daughter. If she had fallen, Patience
could not have forced herself to touch her. Had the
woman been a reeling mass of physical corruption, a
leper, a small-pox scab, the girl could not have
shrunken farther from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not speak until they ascended the hill behind
the town and entered the woods. Patience never
recalled that night without inhaling the balsamic
odour of the pines, the heavy perfume of forest lilies,
without seeing the great yellow stars through the uplifted
arms of the trees. It was a night for love, and
its guest was hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No more terrible conversation ever took place between
mother and daughter. After that night they
never spoke again.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Patience, after breakfast, carried a
pair of tongs and a newspaper up to her room. She
spread the newspaper on the table, then with the
tongs extracted Byron from beneath the bed and laid
it on the paper. She wrapped it up and tied it securely
without letting her hands come in contact with
the cover. That same afternoon she carried the book
to the Custom House and threw it behind a row of tall
volumes in one of the cases. Long after, Mr. Foord
found it there and wondered. He was not at home
when she arrived. When he returned she was deep in
his arm-chair, reading Gibbon’s “Rome.” He was
not without tact, and determined at once to ignore the
events of the previous day and night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” he exclaimed, “are you really giving
poor old Gibbon a trial at last? And after all your
abuse? But perhaps you won’t find him so dry, after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to read what is dry,” said Patience. “I’m
going to take a course in ancient history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more poetry and novels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a line.” She spoke harshly, and compelled
herself to meet Mr. Foord’s eyes. Her own were as
hard and as cold as steel. All the soft dreaming light
of the past two months had gone out of them. They
were the eyes neither of a girl nor of a woman. They
looked the eyes of a sexless intellect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had done the one thing which a girl of
fifteen can do when crushed with problems; she had
twitched her shoulders and flung them off. She comprehended
that her intellect was her best friend, and
plunged her racked head into the hard facts which required
utmost concentration of mind. The sweet
vague dreams of the past were turned from in loathing.
If she thought of them at all it was with fierce resentment
that she had become conscious of her womanhood.
The stranger was thrust out of memory. She
went no more to the tower. The owl hooted in his
loneliness, and she drew the bed-clothes over her ears.
When she walked through the woods, to and from the
town, she recited Gibbon in synopsis. She spent the
day in Mr. Foord’s library, returning home in time to
get supper. She did her household duties mechanically,
and the eyes of mother and daughter never met.
The man Oscar kept out of her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galpin had gone to San Francisco and would
return no more: she was to marry. Rosita was visiting
in Santa Barbara. Manuela, now a young lady,
was devoting the greater part of her time to the Hotel
Del Monte, where the flower and vegetables of San
Francisco gather in summer. She went up to the
tanks in the morning and to the dances in the evening;
and informed Patience, one day as they met on the
street, that she was having a perfectly gorgeous time,
and had met a man who was too lovely for words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long hot days and the foggy nights wore slowly
away. Patience grew thinner, her face harder. Mr.
Foord did his best to divert her, but his resources
were limited. She peremptorily forbade him to allude
to the romance of Monterey, and he took her out in
his old buggy and talked of Gibbon’s “Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once they drove through the grounds of Del Monte,—the
trim artificial grounds that are such an anomaly
in that valley of memories. On the long veranda of the
great hotel of airy architecture people sat in the bright
attire of summer. Matrons rocked and gossiped;
girls talked eagerly to languid youths that sat on the
railing. It was all as unreal to Patience as the fairy-land
of her childhood, when she had hunted for fays
and elves in the wood. She stared at the scene angrily,
for the first time feeling the sting of the social
bee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vain frivolous life those people lead,” remarked
Mr. Foord, who disapproved of The World. “A
waste of time and God’s best gifts, which makes them
selfish and heartless. Empty heads and hollow hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience, gazing at those girls in their gay dainty
attire, the like of which she had never seen before, experienced
a sudden violent wish to be of them, empty
head, hollow heart, and all. They looked happy and
free of care. The very atmosphere of the veranda
seemed full of colour and music. Above all, they were
utterly different from Patience Sparhawk, blessed and
enviable beings. Even the frivolity of the scene appealed
to her, so sick unto death of serious things.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One day, late in September, Patience, as usual, left
Monterey at half past four in order to reach home in
time to cook the supper. Nature had smiled for so
many successive days that she wondered if the lips so
persistently set must not soon strain back and reveal
the teeth. The sun, poised behind the pine woods,
flooded them with yellow light. As Patience walked
through the soft radiance she set her teeth and recalled
the chapters of Thiers’ “French Revolution,” through
which she had that day plodded. But her head felt
dull. She realised with a quiver of terror that she was
beginning to feel less like an intellect and more like a
very helpless little girl. Once she discovered her
curved arm creeping to her eyes. She flung it down
and shook her head angrily. Was she like other
people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mingling with the fragrance of the pines it seemed to
her that she smelt smoke. She hoped that her woods
were not on fire. She walked slowly, indisposed as
ever to return home, the more so to-day as she felt herself
breaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish the sun would not grin so,” she thought.
“I’ll be glad when winter comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smell of smoke grew stronger. She left the
woods. A moment later she stood, white and trembling,
looking down upon Carmel Valley. The Sparhawk
farmhouse was a blazing mass of timbers. A
volume of smoke, as straight and full as a waterspout,
stood directly above it. Men were running about.
Their shouts came faintly to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience pressed her hands convulsively to her eyes.
She clutched her head as if to tear out the terrible
hope clattering in her brain, then ran down the hill and
across the valley, feeling all the while as if possessed by
ten thousand devils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m bad, bad, bad!” she sobbed in terror.
“I don’t, I don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she reached the scene the roof fell in. She
glanced hastily about. The men, withdrawn to a safe
distance, were gathered round the man Oscar. One
was binding his hands and face. As they saw Patience
they turned as if to run, then stood doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?” Patience asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an instant’s pause. The crackling of the
flames grew louder, as if it would answer. Then one
of the men blurted out: “Burnt up in her bed. She
was drunk. We was all in the field when the fire
broke out. When we got here Oscar tried to get at
her room with a ladder, but it was no go. Poor old
Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience without another word turned and ran back
to the woods. She ran until she was exhausted, more
horrified at herself than she had been at any of her unhappy
experiences. After a time she fell among the
dry pine needles, her good, as she expressed it, still
trying to fight down her bad. She felt that the demon
possessing her would have sung aloud had she not held
it by the throat. She conjured up all the horrible details
of her mother’s death and ordered her soul to
pity; but her brain remarked coldly that her mother
had probably felt nothing. She imagined the charred
corpse, but it only offended her artistic sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally she fell asleep. The day was far gone when
she awoke. She lay for a time staring at the dim
arches above her, listening to the night voices she had
once loved so passionately. At last she drew a deep
sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might just as well face the truth,” she said aloud.
“I’m glad, and that’s the end of it. It’s wicked and
I’m sorry; but what is, is, and I can’t help it. We’re
not all made alike.”</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was once more installed in Lola’s room.
Mr. Foord applied for letters of guardianship, which
were granted at once. But as he had feared, she was
left without a penny. He wrote to his half-sister, asking
her if she would take charge of his ward. Miss
Tremont replied in enthusiastic affirmation. Miss
Galpin invited Patience to spend two weeks with her
in San Francisco, offering to replenish the girl’s wardrobe
with several of her own old frocks made over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those two weeks seemed to Patience the mad whirl
of excitement of which she had read in novels. She
had never seen a city before, and the very cable cars
fascinated her. To glide up and down the hills was to
her the poetry of science. The straggling city on its
hundred hills, the crowded streets and gay shop windows,
the theatres, the restaurants, China Town, the
beautiful bay with its bare colorous hills, surprised her
into admitting that life appeared to be quite well worth
living after all. When she returned to Monterey she
talked so fast that Mr. Foord clapped his hands to his
ears, and Rosita listened with expanded eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, if I could live in San Francisco!” she said,
plaintively. “I acted all summer, Patita, but I got
tired of the same people, and I want to go to the big
theatres and see the real ones do it. I’d like to hear
a great big house applauding, only I’d be so jealous of
the leading lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was to start, immediately after Christmas,
by steamer for New York. Mr. Foord spent the last
days giving her much good advice. He said little of
his own sorrow to part from her. Once he had been
tempted to keep her for the short time that remained
to him, but had put the temptation aside with the sad
resignation of old age. He knew Patience’s imperative
need of new impressions in these her plastic years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before she left she went over to Carmel to
say good-bye to Solomon. He flapped his wings with
delight, although he could not see her, and nestled
close to her side in a manner quite unlike his haughty
habit. Patience thought he looked older and greyer,
and his wings had a dejected droop. She took him
in her arms with an impulse of tenderness, and this
time he did not repulse her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Solomon,” she said, “I suppose you are
lonely and forlorn in your old age, but this old tower
wouldn’t be what it is without you. It’s too bad I
can’t write to you as I can to my two or three other
friends, and you’ll never know I haven’t forgotten you,
poor old Solomon. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I wonder
if owls do suffer too. You look so wise and venerable,
perhaps you are thinking that lonely old age is terrible—as
I know Mr. Foord does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solomon pecked at her mildly. Her gaze wandered
out over the ocean. She wondered if a thousand years
had passed since she had dreamed her dreams. Their
very echoes came from the mountains of space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she went away Solomon followed her to the
head of the stair. She looked upward once and saw
him standing there, with drooping wings and head a
little bent. The darkness of the stair gave him vision,
and he fluttered his wings expectantly, as she paused
and lifted her face to him. But when she did not
return he walked with great dignity to his accustomed
place against the wall, nor even lifted up his voice in
protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Rosita accompanied her to the
station and wept loudly as the train approached. But
Patience did not cry until she stood in her stateroom
with Mr. Foord.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience watched the dusty hills of San Francisco, the
sparkling bay alive with sail and spar, the pink mountains
of the far coast range, the brown hills opposite the
grey city, willowed and gulched and bare, the forts on
rock and points, until the wild lurching of the steamer
over the bar directed her attention to the unhappy
passengers. In a short while she had not even these
to amuse her, nothing but a grey plain and empty decks.
At first she felt a waif in space; but soon a delightful
sense of independence stole over her, of freedom from
all the ills and responsibilities of life. The land world
might have collapsed upon its fiery heart, so little could
it affect her while that waste of waters slid under the
horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few passengers came forth restored in a day or
two. A husband and wife and several children did not
interest Patience; neither did the captain’s wife, in
whose charge she was. A young girl with a tangle of
yellow hair under a sailor hat was more inviting, but she
flirted industriously with the purser and took not the
slightest notice of Patience. Her invalid mother
reclined languidly in a steamer chair and read the
novels of E. P. Roe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only other passenger was an elderly gentleman
who read books in white covers neatly lettered with
black which fascinated Patience. She was beginning to
long for books. The invalid lent her a Roe, but she
returned it half unread. As the old gentleman had
never addressed her, did not seem to be aware of her
existence, she could hardly expect a similar courtesy
from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glowering upon universal stupidity one
morning when he appeared on deck with a carpet bag,
from which, after comfortably establishing himself in
his steamer chair, he took little white volume after
little white volume. Patience’s curiosity overcame her.
She went forward slowly and stood before him. He
looked up sharply. His black eyes, piercing from their
shaggy arches, made her twitch her head as if to fling
aside some penetrative force. His very beard, silver
though it was, had a fierce sidewise twist. His nose
was full nostrilled and drooped scornfully. The spectacles
he wore served as a sort of lens for the fire of his
extraordinary eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he said gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir,” said Patience, humbly, “will you lend
me a book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Book? I don’t carry children’s literature round
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t read children’s literature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t? Well, not ‘The Chatterbox,’ I suppose;
but I have nothing of Pansy’s nor yet of The
Duchess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t read them if you had,” cried Patience,
angrily. “Perhaps I’ve read a good many books
that you haven’t re-read so long ago yourself. I’ve
read Dickens and Thackeray and Scott, and,” with
a shudder, “Gibbon’s ‘Rome’ and Thiers’ ‘French
Revolution.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you have? Well, I beg your pardon. Sit
down, and I’ll see if I can find something for a young
lady of your surprising attainments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, too pleased to resent sarcasm, applied
herself to his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are they all bound alike?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the Tauchnitz edition of notable English
and American books. How is this?” He handed her
a volume of Grace Aguilar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir! I’ve tried her, and she’s a greater bore
than Jane Austen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you want a love story, I suppose?” His accentuation
was fairly sardonic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” she said with an intonation which
made him turn and regard her with interest. Then
once more he explored his bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will this suit you?” He held out a copy of
Carlyle’s “French Revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience groaned. “Didn’t I tell you I’d just read
Thiers’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t Thiers’. Try it.” And he took no
further notice of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience opened the volume, and in a few moments
was absorbed. There was something in the storm and
blare of the style which struck a responsive chord. She
did not raise her head until dinner time. She scarcely
spoke until she had finished the volume, and then only
to ask for the second. For several days she felt as if
the atmosphere was charged with dynamite, and jumped
when any one addressed her. The owner of the Tauchnitz
watched her curiously. When she had finished the
second volume she told him that she did not care for
anything more at present. She leaned over the railing
most of the day, watching the waves. Toward sunset
the gentleman called peremptorily,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stood before his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you think of it?” he demanded.
“Tell me exactly what your impressions are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel as if there was an earthquake in my skull
and all sorts of pictures flying about, and exploded
pieces of drums and trumpets, and kings and queens.
I think Carlyle must have been made on purpose to
write the French Revolution. It was—as if—there
was a great picture of it made on the atmosphere, and
when he was born it passed into him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word,” he said, “you are a degree or two
removed from the letters of bread and milk. You are
a very remarkable kid. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience took the chair beside him. “He made my
head ache,” she added. “I feel as if it had been
hammered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder. Older heads have felt the same
way. What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience Sparhawk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me all about yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there isn’t much to tell,” and she frowned
heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look so tragic—you alarm me. I’m convinced
there is a great deal. Come, I want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience gave a few inane particulars. The old
gentleman snorted. “It’s evident you’ve never been
interviewed,” he said grimly. “Now, I’ll tell you who
I am, and then you won’t mind talking about yourself.
There’s nothing so catching as egotism. My name is
James E. Field. I own one of the great newspapers of
New York, of which I am also editor-in-chief. Do
you know what that means? Well, if you don’t, let me
tell you. It is to be a man more powerful than the
President of the United States, for he can make
presidents, which is something the president himself
can’t do. He knows more about people’s private affairs
than any of intimate relationship; he has his finger on
the barometer of his readers’ brain; he can make
them sensational or sober, intellectually careless or
exacting; he can keep them in ignorance of all that is
best worth knowing of the world’s affairs, by snubbing
the great events and tendencies of the day and vitiating
their brain with local crimes and scandals, or he can
illumine their minds and widen their brain cells by not
only enlarging upon what every intelligent person should
wish to know, but by making such matter of profound
interest; he can ignore science, or enlighten several
hundred thousand people; he can add to the happiness
of the human race by exposing abuses and hidden
crime, or he can accept hush money and let the sore
fester; he can lash the unrest of the lower classes, or
chloroform it; he can use the sledge hammer, the
rapier, and the vitriol, or give over his editorial page to
windy nothings; he can demolish political bosses, or
prolong their career. In short, his power is greater than
Alexander’s was, for he is a general of minds instead of
brute force.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My goodness gracious!” exclaimed Patience.
“What sort of a paper have you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Wait until you’ve lived in New
York awhile and you’ll find out. Its name is the
‘Day,’ and it has made a president or two, and made
one or two others wish they’d never been born. By
the way, I didn’t tell you much about myself, did
I? The auxiliary subject carried me away. I’m
married, and have several sons and daughters, and
am off for a rest—not from the family but from the
‘Day.’ I’ve been round the world. That will do for
the present. Tell me all about Monterey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With consummate skill he extracted the history of
her sixteen years. On some points she fought him
so obstinately that he inferred what she would not
tell. He ended by becoming profoundly interested.
He was a man of enthusiasms, which sometimes wrote
themselves in vitriol, at others in the milk of human
kindness. His keen unerring brain, which Patience
fancied flashed electric search lights, comprehended
that it had stumbled upon a character waging perpetual
war with the pitiless Law of Circumstance, and that the
issue might serve as a plot for one of the mental
dramas of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your experience and the bad blood in you, taken
in connection with your bright and essentially modern
mind, will make a sort of intellectual anarchist of you,”
he said. “I doubt if you take kindly to the domestic
life. You will probably go in for the social problems,
and ride some polemical hobby for eight or ten years,
at the end of which time you will be inclined to look
upon your sex as the soubrettes of history. Your
enthusiasm may make you a faddist, but your common
sense may aid you in the perception of several eternal
truths which the women of to-day in their blind bolt
have overlooked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he repented his generalisations, for
Patience had demanded full particulars. Nevertheless,
he gave her many a graphic outline of the various
phases of current history, and was the most potent
educational force that she had yet encountered. She
preferred him to books and admired him without reserve,
trotting at his heels like a small dog. His
unique and virile personality, his brilliant and imperious
mind, magnetised the modern essence of which she
was made. There was nothing of the old-fashioned
intellectual type about him. He might have induced
the coining of the word “brainy,”—he certainly typed
it. Although he had the white hair and the accumulated
wisdom of his years, he had the eyes of youth and
the fist of vigour at any age. One day when two
natives looked too long upon Patience’s blondinity,
as she and Mr. Field were exploring a banana grove
during one of their brief excursions on shore, he
cracked their skulls together as if they had been two
cocoanuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience laughed as the blacks dropped sullenly
behind. “How funny that they should admire me,”
she said. “I’m not pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re white. Besides, there is one thing
more fascinating than beauty, and that is a strong
individuality. It radiates and magnetises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I all that?” Patience blushed with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed good-naturedly. “Yes, I’ll stake a
good deal that you have. You may even be pretty
some day; that is, if you ever get those freckles off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inherent as was her passion for nature, she enjoyed
the rich beauty of the tropics the more for the companionship
of a mind skilled in observation and interpretation.
It was her first mental comprehension of
the law of duality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they approached New York harbour Mr. Field said
to her: “I think I’ll have to make a newspaper
woman of you. When you have finished your education,
don’t think of settling down to any such humdrum
career as that of the school-teacher. Come
to me, and I’ll put you through your paces. If I’m
not more mistaken than I’ve been yet, I’ll turn out
a newspaper woman that will induce a mightier blast
of woman’s horn. Think you’d like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to be with you,” said Patience, on the
verge of tears. “Sha’n’t I see you again till I’m
eighteen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want to see or hear from you again
until you’ve kneaded that brain of yours into some
sort of shape by three years of hard study. Then
I’ll go to work on a good foundation. You haven’t
told me if you’ll take a try at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will. Do you think I want to be
a school-teacher? I should think it would be lovely
to be a newspaper woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it isn’t exactly lovely, but it is a good training
in the art of getting along without adjectives.
Now look round you and I’ll explain this harbour;
and don’t you brag any more about your San Francisco
harbour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered through The Narrows, between the two
toy forts. A few lone sentries paced the crisp snow
on the heights of Staten Island, and looked in imminent
danger of tumbling down the perpendicular lawns.
The little stone windows of the earthen redoubts
seemed to wink confidently at each other across the
water, and loomed superciliously above the forts on
the water’s edge. Long Island, had the repose of a
giant that had stretched his limbs in sleep, unmindful
of the temporary hamlets on his swelling front. Staten
Island curved and uplifted herself coquettishly under
her glittering garb and crystal woods. Far away the
faint line of the New Jersey shore, looking like one
unbroken city on a hundred altitudes, hovered faintly
under its mist. The river at its base was a silver
ribbon between a mirage and a stupendous castle of
seven different architectures surmounted by a golden
dome—which same was New York and the dome
of a newspaper. Then a faint fairy-like bridge, delicate
as a cobweb, sprang lightly across another river to
a city of walls with windows in them—which same
was Brooklyn. Under the shadow of the arches was
a baby island fortified with what appeared to be a large
Dutch cheese out of which the mice had gnawed
their way with much regularity. The great bay, blue
as liquid sapphire, was alive with craft of every
design: rowboats scuttled away from the big outgoing
steamers; sails, white as the snow on the heights,
bellied in the sharp wind; yellow and red ferry boats
gave back long symmetrical curves of white smoke;
gaunt ships with naked spars lay at rest. On Liberty
Island the big girl pointed solemnly upward as if
reminding the city on the waters of the many mansions
in the invisible stars. Snow clouds were scudding
upward from the east, but overhead there was plentiful
gold and blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience gazed through Mr. Field’s glass, enraptured,
and promised not to brag. As they swung toward the
dock he laid his hand kindly on hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t think I’m callous,” he said, “because
I part from you without any apparent regret. You are
going to be in good hands during the rest of your early
girlhood, and I could be of no assistance to you; and
I am a very busy man. Let me tell you that you have
made this month a good deal shorter than it would
otherwise have been; and when we meet again you
won’t have to introduce yourself. There are my folks,
and there goes the gang-plank. Good-bye, and God
bless you.”</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience leaned over the upper railing, looking at the
expectant crowd on the wharf, wondering when the
captain would remember her. She felt a strong inclination
to run after Mr. Field. As he receded up the
wharf, surrounded by his family, he turned and waved
his hand to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why couldn’t he have been Mr. Foord’s brother or
something?” she thought resentfully. “I think he
might have adopted me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the crowd thinned she noticed two elderly women
standing a few feet from the vessel, alternately inspecting
the landed passengers and the decks. One was a very
tall slender and graceful woman, possessed of that subtle
quality called style, despite her unfashionable attire.
In her dark regular face were the remains of beauty,
and although nervous and anxious, it wore the seal of
gentle blood. Her large black eyes expressed a curious
commingling of the spiritual and the human. She was
probably sixty years old. At her side was a woman
some ten years younger, of stouter and less elastic
figure, with a strong dark kind intelligent face and an
utter disregard of dress. She carried several bundles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hasn’t she come?” cried the elder woman.
“Can she have died at sea? I am sure the dear Lord
wouldn’t let anything happen to her. Dear sister, <span class='it'>do</span>
you see her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other woman, who was also looking everywhere
except at Patience, replied in a round cheerful voice:
“No, not yet, but I feel sure she is there. The captain
hasn’t had time to bring her on shore. The Lord
tells me that it is all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of those is Miss Tremont,” thought Patience,
“I may as well go down. They appear to be frightfully
religious, but they have nice faces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran down to the lower deck, then across the
gang-plank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Patience Sparhawk,” she said; “are you—”
The older woman uttered a little cry, caught her in her
arms, and kissed her. “Oh, you dear little thing!”
she exclaimed, and kissed her again. “How I’ve
prayed the dear Lord to bring you safely, and He has,
praise His holy name. Oh, I am so glad to see you. I
do love children so. We’ll be so happy together—you
and I and Him—and, oh, I’m so glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, breathless, but much gratified, kissed her
warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget me,” exclaimed the other lady. She
had a singularly hearty voice and a brilliant smile.
Patience turned to her dutifully, and received an emphatic
kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my dear friend, my dear sister in the Lord,
Miss Beale, Patience,” said Miss Tremont, flurriedly,
“and she wanted to see you almost as much as I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I did,” said Miss Beale, breezily. “I too
love little girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you’re both very kind,” said Patience,
helplessly. She hardly knew how to meet so much
effusion. But something cold and old within her seemed
to warm and thaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear little thing,” continued Miss Tremont.
“Are you cold? That is a very light coat you have on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was not dressed for an eastern winter, but
her young blood and curiosity kept her warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the captain,” she said. “Oh, no, I’m
all right. I like the cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain, satisfying himself that his charge was in
the proper hands, offered to send her trunk to Mariaville
by express, and Patience, wedged closely between
the two ladies, boarded a street car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” exclaimed Miss Tremont, “I knew the
Lord would bring you to me safely in spite of the perils
of the ocean. Every night and every morning I prayed:
<span class='it'>Dear</span> Lord, don’t let anything happen to her,—and I
knew He wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does He always do what you tell Him?” asked
Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost everything I ask Him,—that is to say, when
He thinks best. Dear Patience, if you knew how He
looks out for me—and it is well He sees fit, for dear
knows I have a time taking care of myself. Why, He
even takes care of my purse. I’m always leaving it
round, and He always sends it back to me—from
counters and trains and restaurants and everywhere.
And when I start in the wrong direction He always
whispers in my ear in time. Why, once I had to catch
a certain train to Philadelphia, where I was to preside
at a convention, and I’d taken the wrong street car, and
when I jumped off and took the right one, the driver
said I couldn’t possibly get to the ferry in time. So I
just shut my eyes and prayed; and then I told the driver
that it would be all right, as I had asked the Lord to
see that I got there in time. The driver laughed, and
said: ‘W-a-a-l, I guess the Lord’ll go back on you
this time.’ But I caught that ferry-boat. <span class='it'>He</span>—the
Lord—made it five minutes late. And it’s always the
same. He takes care of me, praised be His name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must feel as if He were your husband,” said
Patience, too gravely to be suspected of irreverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, He is. Doesn’t the Bible say—” But the
car began to rattle over the badly paved streets, and the
quotation was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience looked eagerly through the windows at
purlieus of indescribable ugliness; but it was New
York, a city greater than San Francisco, and she found
even its youthful old age picturesque. The dense
throng of people in Sixth Avenue and the immense
shop windows induced expressions of rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t live here, do you?” she said with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mariaville is much nicer than New York,”
replied Miss Beale, in her enthusiastic way. “I hate a
great crowded city. It baffles you so when you try to
do good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still they do say that reform work is more systematised
here, dear sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty-second Street,” shouted the conductor, and
they changed cars. A few moments later they were
pulling out of the Grand Central Station for Mariaville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale had asked the conductor to turn a seat,
and Patience faced her new friends. As they left the
tunnel she caught sight of a tiny bow of white ribbon
each wore on her coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you wear that?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’re W. C. T. U’s,” replied Miss Beale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wctus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Temperance cranks,” said Miss Tremont, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Temperance cranks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, have you never heard of the Woman’s Christian
Temperance Union?” asked Miss Beale, a chill
breathing over her cordial voice. “The movement
has reason to feel encouraged all through the West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never heard of it. They don’t have it in
Monterey, and I’ve not been much in San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s such a child,” said Miss Tremont. “How
could she know of it out there? But now I know she
is going to be one of our very best Y’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y’s?” asked Patience, helplessly. She wondered
if this was the “fad” Mr. Field had predicted for her,
then recalled that he had alluded once to the “Temperance
movement,” but could not remember his explanation,
if he had made any. Doubtless she had
evaded a disagreeable topic. But now that it was
evidently to be a part of her new life she made no attempt
to stem Miss Tremont’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Y’s are the young women of the Union; we
are the W’s. It is our lifework, Patience, and I am
sure you will become as much interested in it as we
are, and be proud to wear the white ribbon. We have
done so much good, and expect to do much more, with
the dear Lord’s help. It is slow work, but we shall
conquer in the end, for He is with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do,—forbid people to sell liquor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both ladies laughed. They were not without humour,
and their experience had developed it. “No,”
said Miss Tremont, “we don’t waste our time like that.”
She gave an enthusiastic account of what the Union
had accomplished. Her face glowed; her fine head
was thrown back; her dark eyes sparkled. Patience
thought she must have been a beautiful girl. She had
a full voice with odd notes of protest and imperious
demand which puzzled her young charge. One would
have supposed that she was constantly imploring favours,
and yet her air suggested natural hauteur, unexterminated
by cultivated humility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think it was a good idea,” said Patience,
with perfect sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s dear Sister Watt,” cried Miss Tremont,
and she rose precipitately, and crossing the aisle sat
down beside a careworn anxious-eyed woman who
also wore the white ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over by me until Miss Tremont comes back,”
said Miss Beale, with her brilliant smile. “Tell me,
don’t you love her already? Oh, you have no idea
how good she is. She is heart and soul in her work,
and just lives for the Lord. She sometimes visits twenty
poor families a week, besides her Temperance class,
her sewing school, her Bible Readings, her Bible class,
and all the religious societies, of which she is the most
active worker. She is also the Mariaville agent for
the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and
trustee of the Bible Society. You should hear her pray.
I have heard all the great revivalists, but I have never
heard anything like Miss Tremont’s prayers. How I
envy you living with her! You’ll hear her twice a day,
and sometimes oftener. She has a nice house on
the outskirts of Mariaville. Her father left it to her
twenty years ago, and she dedicated it to the Lord at
once. It is headquarters for church meetings of all
sorts. She has a Bible reading one afternoon a week.
Any one can go, even a servant, for Miss Tremont, like
all true followers of the Lord, is humble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience reflected that she had never seen any one
look less humble than Miss Beale. In spite of her old
frock she conveyed with unmistakable if unconscious
emphasis that she possessed wealth and full knowledge
of its power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look so happy,” Patience said, her curiosity
regarding Miss Tremont blunted for the present. “Are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy? Of course I am. I’ve never known an
unhappy moment in my life. When my dear parents
died, I only envied them. And have I not perfect
health? Is not every moment of my time occupied?—why,
I only sleep six hours out of the twenty-four. And
Him. Do I not work for Him, and is He not always
with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are so funny about God,” thought Patience.
“She talks as if He were her beau; and Miss Tremont
as if He were her old man she’d been jogging along
with for forty years or so.—Do you live alone?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—that is, I board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you ever feel lonesome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. Is not He always with me?” Her strong
brown face was suddenly illuminated. “Is He not my
lover? Is He not always at my side, encouraging me
and whispering of His love, night and day? Why,
I can almost hear His voice, feel His hand. How
could I be lonesome even on a desert island with no
work to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience gasped. The extraordinary simplicity of
this woman of fifty fascinated her whom life and
heredity had made so complex. But she moved restlessly,
and felt an impulse to thrust out her legs and
arms. She had a sensation of being swamped in
religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think you’d like boarding,” she said
irrelevantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it particularly, but it gives me more
time for my work. I make myself comfortable, I can
tell you, for I have my own bed with two splendid
mattresses,—my landlady’s are the hardest things you
ever felt,—and all my own furniture and knick-knacks.
And I have my own tub, and every morning even in
dead of winter, I take a cold bath. And I don’t wear
corsets—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mariaville,” called the conductor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here we are,” cried Miss Tremont. She made
a wild dive for her umbrella and bag, seized Patience
by the hand, and rushed up the aisle, followed leisurely
by Miss Beale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow was falling heavily. Patience had watched
it drift and swirl over the Hudson, and should have
liked to give it her undivided attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left the station they were greeted by a
chorus of shrieks: “Have a sleigh? Have a sleigh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, sister?” asked Miss Tremont,
dubiously. “Do you think Patience can walk two
miles in this snow? I don’t like to spend money on
luxuries that I should give to the Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps the sleigh man needs it,” said Patience,
who had no desire to walk two miles in a driving storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better have a sleigh,” said Miss Beale, decidedly.
“We will each pay half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should you pay half,” said Miss Tremont,
in her protesting voice, “when there are three of
us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will pay for myself,” said Patience. “Mr. Foord
gave me a twenty dollar gold piece, and I haven’t spent
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear child!” exclaimed Miss Tremont. “As
if I’d let you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, get in,” said Miss Beale; “we’ll be snowed
under, here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a few minutes later Patience, on the front seat,
was enjoying her first sleigh-ride. She slid down under
the fur robe, and winking the snow stars from her lashes,
looked out eagerly upon Mariaville. The town rose
from the Hudson in a succession of irregular precipitous
terraces. The trees were skeletons, the houses
old, but the effect was very picturesque; and the dancing
crystals, the faint music of bells from far and near,
the wide steep streets, delighted a mind magnetic for
novelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left Miss Beale before a pretty house, standing
in a frozen garden, then climbed to the top of a hill,
slid away to the edge of the town, and drew rein before
an old-fashioned white one-winged house, which stood
well back in a neglected yard behind walnut-trees and
hemlocks. Beyond, closing the town, were the stark
woods. Opposite was a prim little grove in which the
snow stars were dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are,” said Miss Tremont, climbing out.
“Welcome home, Patience dear.” She paid the man,
and hurried down the path. The door was opened
by an elderly square-faced woman, who looked sharply
at Patience, then smiled graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, this is Ellen. She takes good care of
me. Come in. Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow hall ran through the main building, and
was unfurnished but for a table and the stair. Miss
Tremont led the way into a large double room of comfortable
temperature, although no fire was visible.
Bright red curtains covered the windows, a neat black
carpet sprinkled with flowers the floor. The chairs
were stiffly arranged, but upholstered cheerfully, the
tables and mantels crowded with an odd assortment of
cheap and handsome ornaments. The papered walls
were a mosaic of family portraits. In the back parlour
were a bookcase, a piano piled high with hymn-books,
and a dozen or so queer little pulpit chairs. A door
opened from the front parlour into a faded but hospitable
dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience for the first time in her life experienced the
enfolding of the home atmosphere, an experience
denied to many for ever and ever. She turned impulsively,
and throwing her arms about Miss Tremont,
kissed and hugged her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow I feel all made over,” she said apologetically,
and getting very red. “But it is so nice—and
you are so nice—and oh, it is all so different!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Miss Tremont, enraptured, first wished that this
forlorn homely little waif was her very own, then vowed
that neither should ever remember that she was not,
and half carried her up to the bedroom prepared for
her, a white fresh little room overlooking the shelving
town.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next afternoon a sewing woman came and cut
down an old-fashioned but handsome fur-lined cloak
of Miss Tremont’s to Patience’s diminutive needs.
When Miss Tremont returned home, after a hard day’s
work, she brought with her a hood, a pair of woollen
gloves, and a pair of arctics; and Patience felt that she
could weather a New York winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience gave little attention to her clothes.
When she was not watching the snow she was studying
the steady stream of people who called at all hours, and
invariably talked “church” and “temperance.” The
atmosphere was so charged with religion that she was
haunted by an uneasy prescience of a violent explosion
during which Miss Tremont and her friends would sail
upward, leaving her among the débris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her coat finished, she went in town with Miss
Tremont to Temperance Hall. The snow had ceased
to fall. The sun rode solitary on a cold blue sky, the
ground was white and hard. The bare trees glittered
in their crystal garb, icicles jewelled the eaves of the
houses. The telegraph wires, studded with pendent
spheres, looked like a vast diamond necklace of many
strings which only Nature was mighty enough to wear.
The hills were snowdrifts. The Hudson, far below,
moved sluggishly under great blocks of ice. The
Palisades were black and white. Miss Tremont and
Patience walked rapidly, their frozen breath waving
before them in fantastic shapes. It was all very delightful
to Patience, who thrust her hands into her deep
pockets and would have scorned to ride. At times
she danced; new blood, charged with electricity,
seemed shooting through her veins. Miss Tremont’s
older teeth clattered occasionally. She bent forward
slightly, her brow contracted over eyes which seemed
ever seeking something, her long legs carrying her
swiftly and with surprising grace. Patience had solved
the enigma of her voice after hearing her pray, and
she supposed that her eyes were on loyal watch for
the miseries of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time they descended an almost perpendicular
hill to the business part of the town. Beyond a few
level streets the ground rose again, wooded and thickly
built upon. On the left was another hill, which, Miss
Tremont informed her, was Hog Heights, the quarter
of the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streets in the valley twisted and doubled like
the curves of an angry python. In the centre was a
square which might have been called Rome, since all
ways led to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Temperance Hall, a building of Christian-like humility,
stood on a back street flanked by many low-browed
shops. On the first floor were the parlour, reading-room,
and refectory, on the second a large hall, on the
third bedrooms. The hall was already half full of
boys and girls, kept in order by the matron, Mrs.
Blair, a middle-aged woman with the expression of one
who stands no nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Patience,” said Miss Tremont, “you listen
attentively, and next time you can take Mrs. Blair’s
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasion was the weekly assemblage of the
Loyal Legion children, who were being educated in
the ways of temperance. Miss Tremont opened with
the Lord’s Prayer, which she invested with all its meaning;
then the children sang from a temperance hymn-book,
and the lesson began. Miss Tremont read a
series of questions appurtenant to the inevitable results
of unholy indulgence, to which Mrs. Blair read the
answers, which in turn were repeated by the children.
Then they sang “Down with King Alcohol,” a minister
came in and made a dramatic address, and the children,
some of whom were attentive and some extremely
naughty, filed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only come on alternate Fridays,” said Miss
Tremont, as they went downstairs; “Sister Beale takes
the other. Come and see our reading-room. These
are our boarders,” indicating several prim old maids
that sat in the front room by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dining-room a half dozen tramps were imbibing
free soup. The reading-room was empty.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Before a week had passed Patience was so busy that
her old life slept as heavily as a bear in winter. She
passed her difficult examinations and entered the High
School, selecting the three years course, which included
French, German, mathematics, the sciences, literature,
and rhetoric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The recesses and evenings were spent in study, the
afternoons in assisting Miss Tremont; occasionally she
snatched an hour to write to her friends in California.
Besides the temperance work, she had a class in the
church sewing school, kept the books of various societies,
and occasionally visited the poor on Hog
Heights. The work did not interest her, but she was
glad to satisfactorily repay Miss Tremont’s hospitality.
But had she wished to protest she would have realised
its uselessness: she was carried with the tide. It
might be said that Miss Tremont was the tide. Her
enthusiasm had no reflex action, and tore through
obstacles like a mill-race. When night came she was
so weary that more than once Patience offered to put
her to bed; but the offer was declined with a curious
mixture of religious fervour and hauteur. Miss Tremont
had none of the ordinary vanity of woman, but she
resented the imputation that she could not work for
the Lord as ardently at sixty as she had at forty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she prayed Patience listened with bated breath.
A torrent of eloquence boiled from her lips. All the
shortcomings and needs of unregenerate Mariaville,
individual and collective, were laid down with a vehement
precision which could leave the Lord little doubt
of His obligations. The Temperance Cause was rehearsed
with a passion which would have thrilled the
devil. Sounding through all was a wholly unselfconscious
note of command, as when one pleads with
the pocket of an intimate friend for some worthy
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience saw so many disreputable people at this
time that her mother’s pre-eminence was extinguished.
They had a habit of commanding the hospitalities of
Miss Tremont’s barn, sure of two meals and a night’s
lodging. Miss Tremont insisted upon their attendance
at evening prayers, and Patience assumed the task of
persuading them to clean up. Her methods were less
gentle than Miss Tremont’s: when they refused to
wash she turned the hose on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Projected suddenly into the dry bracing cold of an
eastern winter she quickly became robust. Before
spring had come, her back was straight and a faint
colour was in her rounding cheeks. If there had been
time to think about it, or any one to tell her, she would
have discovered that she was growing pretty. But at
this time, despite the distant advances of the High
School boys, Patience found no leisure for vanity.
Sometimes she paused long enough to wonder if she
had any individuality left; if environment was not
stronger than heredity after all; if immediate impressions
could not ever efface those of the past, no matter
how deeply the latter may have been etched into the
plastic mind. But she was quite conscious that she
was happy, despite the vague restlessness and longings
of youth. She loved Miss Tremont with all the sudden
expansion of a long repressed temperament endowed
with a tragic capacity for passionate affection. In
Monterey the iron mould of reserve into which circumstance
had forced her nature, had cramped and
warped what love she had felt for Mr. Foord and
Rosita; but in this novel atmosphere, where love
enfolded her, where everybody respected her, and
knew nothing of her past, where there was not a word
nor an occurrence to remind her of the ugly experiences
of her young life, she quickly became a normal
being, living, belatedly, along the large and generous
lines of her nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no friends of her own age with whom to
discuss the problems dear to the heart of developing
woman. The girls at the High School rarely talked
during recess, and she left hurriedly the moment the
scholars were dismissed for the day. The “Y’s” she
persistently refused to join, as well as the young people’s
societies of Miss Tremont’s church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be your helper in everything,” she said to her
perplexed guardian; “but those girls bore me, and,
you know, I really haven’t time for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Miss Tremont, despite the fact that Patience
gave no sign of spiritual thaw, was the most doting of
old maid parents. After the first few weeks she ceased
to dig in Patience’s soul for the stunted seeds of
Christianity, finding that she only irritated her, and
trusting to the daily sprinkling of habit and example to
promote their ultimate growth.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>With summer came a cessation of school, Loyal
Legion, and sewing school duties; but the Poor took
no vacation and gave none. Nevertheless, Patience
had far more leisure, and borrowed many books from
the town library. She read much of Hugo and Balzac
and Goethe, and in the new intellectual delight forgot
herself more completely than in her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the town was very beautiful in summer,
and she spent many hours rambling along the shadowy
streets whose venerable trees shut the sunlight from
the narrow side ways. The gardens too were full of
trees; and the town from a distance looked like a
densely wooded hillside, a riot of green, out of which
housetops showed like eggs in a nest. Over some of
the steep old streets the maples met, growing denser
and denser down in the perspective, until closed by
the flash of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods on the slope of the Hudson were thick
with great trees dropping a leafy curtain before the
brilliant river, and full of isolated nooks where a girl
could read and dream, unsuspected of the chance
pedestrian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After one long drowsy afternoon by a brook in a
hollow of the woods, Patience returned home to find a
carriage standing before the door. It was a turnout of
extreme elegance. The grey horses were thoroughbreds;
a coachman in livery sat on the box; a footman
stood on the sidewalk. She looked in wonder. Miss
Tremont had no time for the fine people of Mariaville,
and they had ceased to call on her long since.
Moreover, Patience knew every carriage in the town,
and this was not of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went rapidly into the house, youthfully eager for
a new experience. Miss Tremont was seated on the
sofa in the front parlour, holding the hand of a tall
handsomely gowned woman. Patience thought, as she
stood for a moment unobserved, that she had never
seen so cold a face. It was the face of a woman of
fifty, oval and almost regular. The mouth was a
straight line. The clear pale eyes looked like the
reflection of the blue atmosphere on icicles. The
skin was as smooth as a girl’s, the brown hair parted
and waved, the tall figure slender and superbly carried.
She was smiling and patting Miss Tremont’s
hand, but there was little light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patience entered, she turned her head and
regarded her without surprise; she had evidently
heard of her. Miss Tremont’s face illumined, and she
held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Patience,” she said triumphantly. “I
haven’t told you half about the dear child. Patience,
this is my cousin, Mrs. Gardiner Peele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gardiner Peele bent her head patronisingly, and
Patience hated her violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you have a companion,” said the lady,
coldly. “But how is it you haven’t the white ribbon
on her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont blushed. “Oh, I can’t control Patience
in all things,” she said, in half angry deprecation.
“She just won’t wear the ribbon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Peele smiled upon Patience for the first time.
It was a wintry light, but it bespoke approval. “I wish
she could make you take it off,” she said to her relative.
“That dreadful, dreadful <span class='it'>badge</span>. How can you
wear it?—you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, cousin,” said Miss Tremont, laughing good-naturedly,
“we won’t go over all that again. You
know I’m a hopeless crank. All I can do is to pray
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I don’t doubt I need it, although I
attend church quite as regularly as you could wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you are good,” said Miss Tremont, with
enthusiasm, “and of course I don’t expect everybody
to be as interested in Temperance as I am.
But I do wish you loved the world less and the Lord
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Peele gave a low, well modulated laugh. “Now,
Harriet, I want you to be worldly for a few minutes. I
have brought you back two new gowns from Paris, and
I want you, when you come to visit me next week, to
wear them. I have had them trimmed with white
ribbon bows so that no one will notice one more or
less—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not ashamed of my white ribbon,” flashed
out Miss Tremont, then relented. “You dear good
Honora. Yes, I’ll wear them if they’re not too
fashionable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I studied your style. And let me tell you,
Harriet Tremont, that fashionable gowns are what you
should be wearing. It does provoke me so to see
you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Tremont leaned over and kissed her short.
“Now what’s the use of talking to an old crank
like me? I’m a humble servant of my dear Lord,
and I couldn’t be anything else if I had a million.
But you dear thing, I’m so glad to see you once
more. You do look so well. Tell me all about the
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, quite forgotten, listened to the conversation
with deep interest. There was a vague promise of
variety in this new advent. As she watched the woman,
who seemed to have brought with her something of the
atmosphere of all that splendid existence of which she
had longingly read, she was stirred with a certain dissatisfaction:
some dormant chord was struck—as on
the day she drove by Del Monte. When Mrs. Peele
arose to go, she thought that not Balzac himself had
ever looked upon a more elegant woman. Even
Patience’s untrained eye recognised that those long
simple folds, those so quiet textures, were of French
woof and make. And the woman’s carriage was
like unto that of the fictional queen. She nodded
carelessly to Patience, and swept out. When Miss
Tremont returned after watching her guest drive away,
Patience pounced upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Who</span> is she?” she demanded. “And <span class='it'>why</span> didn’t
you tell me you had such a swell for a cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I never tell you?” asked Miss Tremont,
wonderingly. “Why, I was sure I had often talked of
Honora. But I’m so busy I suppose I forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down and fanned herself, smiling. “Honora
Tremont is my first cousin. We used to be great
friends until she married a rich man and became so
dreadfully fashionable. The Lord be praised, she has
always loved me; but she lives a great deal abroad, and
spends her winters, when she is here, in New York.
They have a beautiful place on the Hudson, Peele
Manor, that has been in the family for nearly three hundred
years. Mr. Peele is an eminent lawyer. I don’t
know him very well. He doesn’t talk much; I suppose
he has to talk so much in Court. I’ve not seen
the children for a year. I always thought them pretty
badly spoiled, particularly Beverly. May isn’t very
bright. But I always liked Hal—short for Harriet,
after me—better than any of them. She is about
nineteen now. May is eighteen and Beverly twenty-four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there is Honora, cousin Honora’s sister
Mary’s child, and the tallest woman I ever saw. Her
parents died when she was a little thing and left her
without a dollar. Honora took her, and has treated
her like her own children. Sometimes I think she is
very much under her influence. I don’t know why,
but I never liked her. She is Beverly’s age. Oh!”
she burst out, “just think! I have got to go to Peele
Manor for a week. I promised. I couldn’t help it.
And oh, I do dread it. They are all so different, and
they don’t sympathise with my work. Much as I love
them I’m always glad to get away. Wasn’t it kind
and good of her to bring me two dresses from Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shrewdly interpreted the prompting of Mrs.
Peele’s generosity, but made no comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont drew a great sigh: “My temperance
work—my poor—what will they do without me?
Maria Twist gets so mad when I don’t read the Bible
to her twice a week. Patience, you will have to stay
in Temperance Hall. I shouldn’t like to think of you
here alone. I do wish Honora had asked you too—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t go for worlds. When do you think
your dresses will come? I do so want to see a real
Paris dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said they’d come to-morrow. Oh, to think of
wearing stiff tight things. Well, if they are uncomfortable
or too stylish I just won’t wear them, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just will, auntie dear. You’ll not look any
less fine than those people, or I’ll not go near Hog
Heights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont kissed her, grateful for the fondness
displayed. “Well, well, we’ll see,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next day, when the two handsome black
gowns lay on the bed of the spare room, she shook her
head with flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t wear those things,” she cried. “Why, they
were made for a society woman, not for an humble
follower of the Lord. I should be miserable in
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, who had been hovering over the gowns,—one
of silk grenadine trimmed with long loops of black
and white ribbon, the other of satin with a soft knot of
white ribbon on the shoulder and another at the back
of the high collar,—came forward and firmly divested
Miss Tremont of her alpaca. She lifted the heavy
satin gown with reverent hands and slipped it over
Miss Tremont’s head, then hooked it with deft fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” she exclaimed. “You look like a swell
at last. Just what you ought to look like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont glanced at the mirror with a brief spasm
of youthful vanity. The rich fashionable gown became
her long slender figure, her unconscious pride of carriage,
far better than did her old alpaca and merino
frocks. But she shook her head immediately, her
eyes flashing under a quick frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea of perching a white bow like a butterfly
on my shoulder and another at the back of my neck,
as if I had a scar. It’s an insult to the white ribbon.
And this collar would choke me. I can’t breathe.
Take it off! Take it off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until I have admired you some more. You
look just grand. If the collar is too high, I’ll send for
Mrs. Best, and we’ll cut it off and sew some soft black
stuff in the neck—although I just hate to. Auntie
dear, don’t you think you could stand it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont shook her head with decision. “I
couldn’t. It hurts my old throat. And how could I
ever bend my head to get at my soup? And these
bows make me feel actually cross. If the dress can
be made comfortable I’ll wear it, for I’ve no right to
disgrace Honora, nor would I hurt her feelings by
scorning her gowns; but I’ll not stand any such mockery
as these flaunting white things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience exchanged the satin for the grenadine gown.
This met with more tolerance at first, as the throat was
finished with soft folds, and the white ribbon was less
demonstrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It floats so,” said Patience, ecstatically. “Oh,
auntie, you <span class='it'>are</span> a beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I a beauty with my ugly scowling old face? But
this thing is like a ball dress, Patience—this thin stuff!
I prefer the satin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will wear this on the hot evenings. All thin
things are not made for the ball-room. You needn’t
look at yourself like that. I only wish I’d ever be
half as pretty. Auntie, why didn’t you ever marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont’s face worked after all the years.
Memories could not die in so uniform a nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My youth was very sad,” she said, turning away
abruptly. “I only talk about it with the dear Lord.”
And Patience asked no more questions.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The dressmaker was sent for, and the satin gown
divested of its collar. Miss Tremont ruthlessly clipped
off the beautiful French bows and sewed a tiny one of
narrow white ribbon in a conspicuous place on the left
chest. The grenadine was decorated in like manner.
Patience wailed, and then laughed as she thought of
Mrs. Gardiner Peele. She wished she might be there
to see that lady’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont changed her mind four times as to the
possibility of leaving Mariaville for a week of sinful
idleness, before she was finally assisted into the train by
Patience’s firm hand. Even then she abruptly left her
seat and started for the door. But the train was moving.
Patience saw her resume her seat with an impatient
twitch of her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor auntie,” she thought, as she walked up the
street; “but on the whole I think I pity Mrs. Peele
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her bag had been sent to Temperance Hall, and she
went directly there, and to her own room. As the day
was very warm, she exchanged her frock for a print
wrapper, then extended herself on the bed with “’93.”
It was her duty to assuage the wrath of Maria Twist,
but she made up her mind that for twenty-four hours
she would shirk every duty on her calendar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had failed to make allowance for the net of
circumstance. She had not turned ten pages when she
heard the sound of agitated footsteps in the hall. A
moment later Mrs. Blair opened the door unceremoniously.
Her usually placid face was much perturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Patience,” she said, “I’m in such a way.
Late last night a poor man fell at the door, and I took
him in as there was no policeman around. I thought
he was only ill, but it seems he was drunk. He’s been
awake now for two hours, and is awful bad—not drunk,
but suffering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you send for the doctor?” asked Patience,
lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have, but he’s gone to New York and won’t be
back till night. The man says he can doctor himself—that
all he wants is whisky; but of course I can’t give
him that. Do come over and talk to him. Miss Beale
is over at White Plains, and I don’t know what to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience rose reluctantly and followed the matron to
the side of the house reserved for men. As she went
down the hall she heard groans and sharp spasmodic
cries. Mrs. Blair opened a door, and Patience saw
an elderly man lying in the bed. His grey hair and
beard were ragged, his eyes dim and bleared, his long,
well-cut but ignoble face was greenishly pale. He was
very weak, and lay clutching at the bed clothes with
limp hairy hands. As he saw the matron his eyes lit
up with resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t come here to be murdered,” he ejaculated.
“It’s the last place I’d have come to if I’d
known what I was doing. But I tell you that if I don’t
have a drink of whisky I’ll be a dead man in an
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t give you that,” said Mrs. Blair, desperately.
“And you know you only think you need it, anyhow.
We try to make men overcome their terrible weakness;
we don’t encourage them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, but you can’t reform a man when
his inside is on fire and feels as if it were dropping
out—but my God! I can’t argue with you, damn
you. Give it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m of the opinion that he ought to have it,”
said Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man turned to her eagerly. “Bless you,” he
said. “It’s not the taste of it I’m craving, miss; it’s
relief from this awful agony. If you give it to me, I
swear I’ll try never to touch a drop again after I get
over this spree. It’ll be bad enough to break off then,
but it’s death now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blair looked at him with pity, but shook her
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been here seven years,” she said to Patience,
“and the ladies have yet to find one fault with me.
I don’t dare give it to him. Besides, I don’t believe
in it. How can what’s killing him cure him? And
it’s a sin. Even if the ladies excused me—which
they wouldn’t—I’d never forgive myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the responsibility,” said Patience. “I
believe that man will die if he doesn’t have whisky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man groaned and tossed his arms. “Oh, my
God!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blair shuddered. “Oh, I don’t know, miss.
If you will take the responsibility—I can’t give it
to him—where could you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a drug store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t sell it to you—we’ve got a law
passed, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll go to a saloon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my! my!” cried Mrs. Blair, “you’d never
do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is in agony. Can’t you see? I’m going
this minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and Miss Beale entered. She
looked warm and tired, but came forward with active
step, and stood beside the bed. A spasm of disgust
crossed her face. “What is the matter, my man?”
she asked. “I am sorry to see you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me whisky,” groaned the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale turned away with twitching mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is dying. Nothing but whisky can save
him,” said Patience. “If you called a doctor he
would tell you the same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” said Miss Beale, coldly, “do you suppose
that he can have whisky in Temperance Hall?
Is that what we are here for? You must be crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t want him to die on your hands, do
you?” exclaimed Patience, who was losing her temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” screeched the man, “I am in Hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good man,” said Miss Beale, gently, “it is for
us to save you from Hell, not to send you there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be there in ten minutes.” His voice died to an
inarticulate murmur; but he writhed, and doubled, and
twisted, as men may have done when fanatics tortured
in the name of religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, Miss Beale,” cried Patience, excitedly,
“you can’t set yourself up in opposition to nature.
That man must have whisky. If he were younger and
stronger it wouldn’t matter so much; but can’t you see
he hasn’t strength to resist the terrible strain? The
torture is killing him, eating out his life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is terrible!” exclaimed the matron. “Perhaps
it is best—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Blair!” Miss Beale turned upon her in consternation.
Then she bent over the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have whisky,” she said gently; “not if
I thought you were really dying would I give it to you.
If it is the Lord’s will that you are to die here you
must abide by it. I shall not permit you to further
imperil your soul. Nor could that which has not the
blessing of God on it be of benefit to you. Alcohol is a
destroyer, both of soul and of body—not a medicine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s knees suddenly shot up to his chest;
but he raised his head and darted at her a glance of
implacable hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you,” he stuttered. “Murderer—” Then
he extended rigid arms and clutched the bed clothes,
his body twitching uncontrollably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale looked upon him with deep compassion.
“Poor thing,” she exclaimed, “is not this enough to
warn all men from that fiend?” She laid her hand
on the man’s head, but he shook it off with an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whisky,” he cried. “O my God! Have these
women—<span class='it'>women!</span>—no pity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going for whisky—” said Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale stepped swiftly to the door, locked it, and
slipped the key into her pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will buy no whisky,” she said sternly. “I
will save you from that sin.” Suddenly her face lit
up. “I will pray,” she said solemnly, “I will pray that
this poor lost creature may recover, and lead a better
life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear I’ll never touch another drop after I’m
out of this if you’ll give it to me now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it be the Lord’s will that you shall live you will
not die,” said Miss Beale. “I will pray, and in His
mercy He may let you live to repent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell upon her knees by the bed, and clasping her
hands, prayed aloud; while the man reared and plunged
and groaned and cursed, his voice and body momentarily
weaker. Miss Beale’s prayers were always very
long and very fervid. She was not eloquent, but her
deep tear-voiced earnestness was most impressive; and
never more so than to-day, when she flung herself
before the throne of Grace with a lost soul in her hand.
A light like a halo played upon her spiritualised face,
her voice became ineffably sweet. Gradually, in her
ecstatic communion with, her intimate nearness to her
God, she forgot the man on the bed, forgot the flesh
which prisoned her soaring soul, was conscious only of
the divine light pouring through her, the almost palpable
touch of her lover’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Patience exclaimed brutally: “The man is
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale arose with a start. She drew the sheet
gently over the distorted face. “It is the Lord’s will,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Patience was in her own room and had relieved
her feelings by slamming the door, she sat for a
long time staring at the pattern of the carpet and pondering
upon the problem of Miss Beale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she thought finally, “<span class='it'>she’s</span> happy, so I
suppose it’s all right. No wonder she’s satisfied with
herself when she lives up to her ideals as consistently
as that. I think I’ll label all the different forms of
selfishness I come across. There seems to be a large
variety, but all put together don’t seem to be a patch
to having fun with your ideals. Miss Beale would be
the most wretched woman in Westchester county if
she’d given that man whisky and saved his life.”</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The man was buried with Christian service at Miss
Beale’s expense, and her serene face wore no shadow.
The following day she said to Patience: “I spent
nearly all of the last two nights in prayer, and I almost
heard the Lord’s voice as He told me I did right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to write a novel,” said Patience, drily,
but the sarcasm was lost. In a moment Patience forgot
Miss Beale: the postman handed her two letters,
and she went up to her room to read them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first she opened was from Miss Tremont.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Peele Manor</span>, Friday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh my dear darling little girl, how I wish, <span class='it'>how</span> I wish
I were with you and my work once more. I ought to be
happy because they are all so kind, but I’m not. I feel as
if I were throwing away one of the few precious weeks I
have left to give to the Lord (arrange for a prayer meeting
on Wednesday, the day of my return, and we’ll have a
regular feast of manna). Do you miss me? I think of
you every moment. You should have seen dear Cousin
Honora’s face when I came down to dinner in the black
satin. She didn’t say anything, she just <span class='it'>looked</span> at the
bow, and I felt sorry for her. But I know I am right.
Hal giggled and winked at me. (I do love Hal!) Honora
Mairs said so sweetly after Cousin Honora had left the
room: “Dear Cousin Harriet, I think you are so brave and
consistent to wear the little white bow of your cause. It
is so <span class='it'>like</span> you.” Was not that sweet of her? Beverly has
very heavy eyebrows, and he raised them at my ribbon,
and turned away his head as if it hurt his eyes. He is a
very elegant young gentleman, and his mother says he is
a great stickler for form, whatever that may mean. (They
speak a different language here anyway. I don’t understand
half what they say. Hal talks slang all the time.)
I don’t like Beverly as much as I did, although he’s quite
the handsomest young man I ever saw and very polite; but
he smokes cigarettes all the time and big black cigars.
When I told him that five hundred million dollars were spent
annually on tobacco, he got up and went off in a huff. May
is just a talkative child—I never heard any one talk so much
in my life,—and about nothing but gowns and young men
and balls and the opera. Beverly talks about horses all
the time, and Hal thinks a great deal of society, although
she listens to me very sweetly when I talk to her about my
work. Yesterday she said: “Why, Cousin Harriet, you’re
a regular steam engine. It must be jolly good fun to carry
a lot of sinners to heaven on an express train.” I told her
it was a freight train, and it certainly is, as you know,
Patience dear. She replied: “Well, if you get there all
the same, a century more or less doesn’t make any difference.
You must be right in it with the Lord.” That was
the only time I’d heard the dear Lord’s name mentioned
since I arrived, so I didn’t scold her. But Patience, dear,
I hope you’ll never use slang. I’ve talked to Hal about
you, and she says she’s coming to see you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora doesn’t use slang. She is very stately and
dignified, and Cousin Honora (it’s very awkward when
you’re writing for two people to have the same name, isn’t
it?) holds her up as a model for the girls. Hal and
she <span class='it'>fight</span>. I can’t call it anything else, although Honora
doesn’t lose her temper and Hal does. Hal said to me (of
Honora) yesterday (I use her own words, although they’re
awful; but if I didn’t I couldn’t give you the same idea of
her): “She’s a d—— hypocrite: and she wants to marry
Beverly, but she won’t,—not if I have to turn matchmaker
and marry him to a variety actress. She makes me wild.
I wish she’d elope with the priest, but she’s too confoundedly
clever.” Isn’t it dreadful—Honora is a Catholic.
She became converted last year. Perhaps that’s the reason
I can’t like her. But even the Catholic religion teaches
charity, for she said to me this morning: “Poor Hal is
really a good-hearted child, but she’s worldly and just a
little superficial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They haven’t any company this week—how kind of
Cousin Honora to ask me when they are alone! I wish you
were here to enjoy the library. It is a great big room overlooking
the river, and the walls are covered with books—three
or four generations of them. Mr. Peele is intellectual,
and so is Honora; but the others don’t read much, except
Hal, who reads dreadful-looking yellow paper books
written in the French language which she says are “corkers,”
whatever that may mean. I do wish the dear child would
read her Bible. I asked her if I gave her a copy if she’d
promise me to read a little every day, and she said she
would, as some of the stories were as good as a French
novel. So I shall buy her one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sit in the library every evening. In the morning
we sit in the Tea House on the slope and Honora embroiders
Catholic Church things, Cousin Honora knits (she
says it’s all the fashion), May <span class='it'>talks</span>, and Hal reads her yellow
books and tells May to “let up.” I sew for my poor,
and they don’t seem to mind that as much as the white ribbon.
They say that they always sew for the poor in Lent.
Hal says it is the “swagger thing.” In the afternoon we
drive, and I do think it such a waste of time to be going,
going nowhere for two hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, Patience, I shall be with you on Wednesday, praise
the Lord. Come to the train and meet me, and be sure to
write me about <span class='it'>everything</span>. How is Polly Jones, and old
Mrs. Murphy, and Belinda Greggs? Have you read to
Maria Twist, and taken the broth to old Jonas Hobb?
Give my love to dear sister Beale, and tell her I pray for
her. With a kiss from your old auntie, God bless you,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Harriet Tremont.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old soul,” thought Patience. “I think I
know them better than she does, already. She is
worth the whole selfish crowd; but I should like to
know Hal. Beverly must be a chump.”</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The other letter was from Rosita. Patience had not
heard from her for a long while. Three months previously,
Mr. Foord had written of Mrs. Thrailkill’s
death, and mentioned that Rosita had gone to Sacramento
to visit Miss Galpin—now Mrs. Trent—until
her uncle, who had returned to Kentucky, should send
for her.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Patita! Patita! [the letter began], what do you
think? <span class='it'>I am on the stage.</span> I had been crazy to go on ever
since <span class='it'>that night</span>. A theatrical man was in Monterey just before
mamma’s death, and he told me they were always wanting
pretty corus girls at the Tivoli; so after the funeral I
told everybody I was going to stay with Miss Galpin until
Uncle Jim sent for me—I hated to lie, but I had to—and
I went up to San Francisco and went right to the Tivoli.
He took me because he said I was pretty and had a fresh
voice. I had to ware tights. You should have seen me.
At first I felt all the time like stooping over to cover up my
legs with my arms. But after a while I got used to it, and
one night we had to dance, and everybody said I was the
most graceful. The manager said I was a born dancer and
actress. The other day what do you think happened? A
New York manager was here and heard me sing,—I had a
little part by that time,—and he told me that if I took lessons
I could be a prima donna in comic opera. He said I
not only was going to have a lovely voice, but that I had a
new style (Spanish) and would take in New York. He offered
to send me to Paris for a year and then bring me out
in New York if I’d give him my word—I’m too young to
sign a contract—that I wouldn’t go with any other manager.
At first my manager, who is a good old sole (I didn’t tell
you that I live with him and his wife, and that their awful
good to me and stand the fellers off), wouldn’t have it; but
after a while he gave in—said I’d have to go the pace
sooner or later (whatever that means), and I might as well
go it in first class style. His wife, the good old sole, cried.
She said I was the first corus girl she’d ever taken an interest
in, but somehow it would be on her conscience if
I went wrong. But I’m not going wrong. I don’t
care a bit for men. There was a bald-headed old
fool who used to come and sit in the front row every
night and throw kisses to me, and one night he threw
me a bouquet with a bracelet in it. I wore the bracelet,
for it was a beauty with a big diamond in it; but I never
looked at him or answered any of his notes, and Mr. Bell—the
manager—wrote him he’d punch his head if he came
near the stage door. No, all I want is to act, act, act, and
sing, sing, sing, and dance, dance, dance, and have beautiful
cloths and jewels and a carriage and two horses. Mr.
Soper has told me ten times since I’ve met him that “virtue
in an actress pays,” and he’s going to send a horrid old
woman with me to Paris, as if I’d bother with the fools anyhow.
I’m sure I can’t see what Mrs. Bell cries about if I’m
going to be famous and make a lot of money. Anyhow, I’m
going. I do so want to see you, Patita dear. Maybe you
can come up to the steamer and see me off. I wonder if
you have changed. I’m not so very tall; but they all say
my figure is good. Mr. Soper says it will be divine in a year
or two, but that I may be a cow at thirty, so I’d better not
lose any time. Good-bye. Good-bye. I want to give you
a hundred kisses. How different our lives are! Isn’t
yours dreadfully stupid with that old temprance work?
And just think it was you who taught me to act first! Mr.
Soper says I must cultivate the Spanish racket for all it’s
worth, and that he expects me to be more Spanish in New
York than I was in Monterey. He is going to get an opera
written for me with the part of a Spanish girl in it so I can
wear the costume. He says if I study and do everything
he tells me I’ll make a <span class='it'>furore</span>. <span class='it'>Hasta luego</span>—Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Rosita Elvira Francesca Thrailkill.</span></p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>P. S.—I’m to have a Spanish stage name, “La Rosita,”
I guess. Mr. Soper says that Thrailkill is an “anti-climax,”
and would never “go down.”</p>

</div>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience read this letter with some alarm. All that she
had heard and read of the stage made her apprehensive.
She feared that Rosita would become fast, would
drink and smoke, and not maintain a proper reserve
with men. Then the natural independence of her character
asserted itself, and she felt pride in Rosita’s courage
and promptness of action. She even envied her a
little: her life would be so full of variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And after all it’s fate,” she thought philosophically.
“She was cut out for the stage if ever a girl was.
You might as well try to keep a bird from using its
wings, or Miss Beale and auntie from being Temperance.
I wonder what my fate is. It’s not the stage,
but it’s not this, neither—not much. Shouldn’t wonder
if I made a break for Mr. Field some day. But I
couldn’t leave auntie. She’s the kind that gets a hold
on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did her duty by Hog Heights during Miss Tremont’s
brief holiday, but did it as concisely as was
practicable. She found it impossible to sympathise with
people that were content to let others support them,
giving nothing in return. Her strong independent
nature despised voluntary weakness. It was her private
opinion that these useless creatures with only the animal
instinct to live, and not an ounce of grey matter in
their skulls, encumbered the earth, and should be
quietly chloroformed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite her love for Miss Tremont, she breathed
more freely in her absence. She was surfeited with
religion, and at times possessed with a very flood of
revolt and the desire to let it loose upon every church
worker in Mariaville. But affection and gratitude
restrained her.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont returned on Wednesday morning.
She stepped off the train with a bag under one arm, a
bundle under the other, and both arms full of flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you darling, you darling!” she cried as she
fell upon Patience. “How it does my heart good to
see you! These are for you. Hal picked them, and
sent her love. Aren’t they sweet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely,” said Patience, crushing the flowers as she
hugged and kissed Miss Tremont. “Here, give me
the bag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont would go to Temperance Hall first,
then to call upon Miss Beale, but was finally guided to
her home. The trunk had preceded them. Patience
unpacked the despised gowns, while listening to a passionate
dissertation upon the heavy trial they had been
to their owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you had a good time all the same,” she
said. “You look as if you’d had, at any rate. You’ve
not looked so well since I came. That sort of thing
agrees with you better than tramping over Hog
Heights—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does not!” cried Miss Tremont. “And I am
so glad to get back to my work and my little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Lord,” supplemented Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, He was with me even there. Only He didn’t
feel so near.” She sighed reminiscently. “But I’ve
brought pictures of the children to show you. Let us
go down to the parlour where it’s cooler, and then
we’ll stand them in a row on the mantel. They’re
the first pictures I’ve had of them in years.” She
caught a package from the tray of her trunk, in her
usual abrupt fashion, and hurried downstairs, Patience
at her heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont seated herself in her favourite upright
chair, put on her spectacles, and opened the package.
“This is Hal,” she said, handing one of the photographs
to Patience. “I must show you her first, for
she’s my pet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience examined the photograph eagerly. It was
a half length of a girl with a straight tilted nose, a
small mouth with a downward droop at the corners,
large rather prominent eyes, and sleek hair which was
in keeping with her generally well-groomed appearance.
She wore a tailor frock. Her slender erect figure
was beautifully poised. In one hand she carried a
lorgnette. She was not pretty, but her expression
was frank and graceful, and she had much distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like her. Any one could see she was a swell.
What colour hair has she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a kind of brown. Her eyes are a sort of
grey. Here is May. She always has her photographs
coloured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s a beauty!” The girl even in photograph
showed an exquisite bit of flesh and blood. The
large blue eyes were young and appealing under soft
fall of lash. The mouth was small and red, the nose
small and straight. Chestnut hair curled about the
small head and oval face. The skin was like tinted
jade. It was the face of the American aftermath. She
wore a ball gown revealing a slender girlish neck and
a throat of tender curves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a real beauty,” said Miss Tremont. “Poor
Hal says, ‘she can’t wear her neck because she hasn’t
got any.’ Did you ever hear such an expression?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal looks as if she had a good figure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont shook her head. “I don’t approve
of all Hal does—she pads. She doesn’t seem to care
much who knows it, for when the weather’s very warm
she takes them out, right before your eyes, so it isn’t so
bad as if she were deceitful about it. Here is Beverly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience looked long at the young man’s face. This
face too was oval, with a high intellectual forehead,
broad black brows, and very regular features. The
mouth appeared to pout beneath the drooping moustache.
The expression of the eyes was very sweet. It
was a strong handsome face, high-bred like the others,
but with a certain nobility lacking in the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is said to be the handsomest young man in
Westchester County, and he’s quite dark,” said Miss
Tremont. “What do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is rather handsome. Where is Honora?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She never has pictures taken. But, dear me, I must
go out and see Ellen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience disposed the photographs on the mantel,
then, leaning on her elbows, gazed upon Beverly Peele.
The Composite, Byron, the Stranger, rattled their bones
unheard. She concluded that no knight of olden
time could ever have been so wholly satisfactory as
this young man. Romance, who had been boxed
about the ears, and sent to sleep, crept to her old
throne with a sly and meaning smile. Patience began
at once to imagine her meeting with Beverly Peele.
She would be in a runaway carriage, and he would rescue
her. She would be skating and fall in a hole, and
he would pull her out. He would be riding to hounds
in his beautiful pink coat (which was red) and run
over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pictured his face with a variety of expressions.
She was sure that he had the courage of a lion and the
tenderness of some women. Unquestionably he had
read his ancestors’ entire library—“with that forehead,”—and
he probably had the high and mighty air
of her favourite heroes of fiction. In one of her letters
Miss Tremont had remarked that he loved children and
animals; therefore he had a beautiful character and a
kind heart. And she was glad to have heard that he
also had a temper: it saved him from being a prig.
Altogether, Patience, with the wisdom of sixteen and
three quarters, was quite convinced that she had found
her ideal, and overlooked its extreme unlikeness to the
Composite, which was the only ideal she had ever
created. A woman’s ideal is the man she is in love
with for the time being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went up to her room, and for the first time in
her life critically examined herself in the mirror. With
May Peele and one or two beauties of the High School
in mind, she decided with a sigh that <span class='it'>she</span> was no
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who knows,” she thought with true insight,
“what I’d be with clothes? Who could be pretty in a
calico dress? My nose is as straight as May’s, anyhow,
and my upper lip as short. But to be a real beauty
you’ve got to have blue eyes and golden or chestnut
hair and a little mouth, or else black eyes and hair like
Rosita’s. My eyes are only grey, and my hair’s the
colour of ashes, as Rosita once remarked. There’s no
getting over that, although it certainly has grown a lot
since I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she remembered that Rosita had once decorated
her with red ribbons and assured her that they
were becoming. She ran down to the best spare room,
and, divesting a tidy of its scarlet bows, pinned them
upon herself before the mirror, which she discovered
was more becoming than her own. The brilliant colour
was undoubtedly improving—“And, my goodness!”
she exclaimed suddenly, “I do believe I haven’t
got a freckle left. It must be the climate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you doing?” said an abrupt
voice from the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience started guiltily, and restored the bows to the
tidy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you see,” she stammered, “May is so pretty
I wanted to see if I could be a little less homely.”
Patience was truthful by nature, but the woman does
not live that will not lie under purely feminine provocation.
Otherwise she would not be worthy to bear the
hallowed name of woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Miss Tremont, crossly, “I
thought you were above that kind of foolishness. You,
must remember that you are as the Lord made you,
and be thankful that you were not born a negro or a
Chinaman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am,” said Patience.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, Patience roamed the woods munching
chestnuts and dreaming of Beverly Peele. Hugo and
Balzac and Goethe were neglected. Her brain wove
thrilling romances of its own, especially in the night to
the sound of rain. She never emerged from the woods
without a shortening of the breath; but even Hal did
not pay the promised call; nor did Beverly dash
through the streets in a pink coat, a charger clasped
between his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s fun to be in love, anyhow,” she thought.
“I’ll meet him some time, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much to her regret she was not permitted to go to
New York to see Rosita off. Miss Tremont had a
morbid horror of the stage, and after Patience’s exhibition
of vanity was convinced that “actress creatures”
would exert a pernicious influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, shortly after, Patience received news which
made her forget Rosita and even Beverly Peele for a
while. Mr. Foord was dead. Patience had hoarded
his twenty dollar gold piece because he had given it to
her. She bought a black hat and frock with it, and
felt as sad as she could at that age of shifting impressions.
A later mail brought word that he had left her
John Sparhawk’s library, which could stay in the Custom
House until she was able to send for it, and a few hundred
dollars which would remain in a savings bank until
she was eighteen. He had nothing else to leave
except his books, which went to found a town library.
All but those few hundreds had been sunken in an annuity.
Miss Tremont was quite content to be overlooked
in the girl’s favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Patience was ready to return to Beverly
Peele the new term opened, and the uncompromising
methods of the High School left no time for romance.
Once more her ambition to excel became paramount,
and she studied night and day. She had no temptation
to dissipate, for she was not popular with the young
people of Mariaville. The Y’s disapproved of her because
she would not don the white ribbon; and the
church girls, generally, felt that except when perfunctorily
assisting Miss Tremont she held herself aloof,
even at the frequent sociables. And they were scandalised
because she did not join the church, nor the
King’s Daughters, nor the Christian Endeavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The High School scholars liked her because she was
“square,” and cordially admired her cleverness; but
there were no recesses in the ordinary sense, and after
school Miss Tremont claimed her. Even the boys
“had no show,” as they phrased it. Occasionally they
lent her a hand on the ice; but like all Californians,
she bitterly felt the cold of her second winter, and in
her few leisure hours preferred the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes she looked at Beverly Peele’s picture
with a sigh and some resentment. “But never mind,”
she would think philosophically, “I can fall in love
with him over again next summer.” When vacation
came she did in a measure take up the broken threads
of her romance, but they had somewhat rotted from
disuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita wrote every few weeks, reporting hard work
and unbounded hope. “The <span class='it'>dueña</span>,” as she called
her companion, “was an old devil,” and never let her
go out alone, nor receive a man; but she “didn’t
care,” she had no time for nonsense, anyhow. She
was learning her part in the Spanish opera, which had
been written for her, and it was “lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a delightful sensation to have your
future assured at seventeen,” thought Patience.
“Mine is as problematical as the outcome of the Temperance
cause. I have had one unexpected change,
and may have more. If it were not for Rosita’s letters
I should almost forget those sixteen years in California.
I certainly am not the same person. I haven’t lost
my temper for a year and a half, and I don’t seem to
be disturbed any more by vague yearnings. Life is too
practical, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont did not visit the Gardiner Peeles this
summer: they spent the season in travel. Late in the
fall Rosita returned to America. She wrote the day
before she sailed. That was the last letter Patience received
from her. Later she sent a large envelope full
of clippings descriptive of her triumphal début; thereafter
nothing whatever. Patience, supposing herself
forgotten, anathematised her old friend wrathfully, but
pride forbade her to write and demand an explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed with spasms of terror that Miss Tremont
was failing. The rush and worry of a lifetime had
worn the blood white, and the nerve-force down like an
old wharf pile. But Miss Tremont would not admit
that she had lost an ounce of strength. She arose at
the same hour and toiled until late. When Patience
begged her to take care of herself, she became almost
querulous, and all Patience could do was to anticipate
her in every possible way. But when school reopened
she had little time for anything but study. She was
to finish in June, and the last year’s course was very
difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She graduated with flying colours, and Miss Tremont
was so proud and excited that she took a day’s vacation.
A week later Patience hinted that she thought
she should be earning her own living; but Miss Tremont
would not even discuss the subject. She fell into a
rage every time it was broached, and Patience, who
would have rebelled, had Miss Tremont been younger
and stronger, submitted: she knew it would not be for
long.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was languid all summer, and lay about in
the woods, when she could, reading little and thinking
much. Her school books put away forever, she felt
for the first time that she was a woman, but did not
take as much interest in herself as she had thought she
should. She speculated a good deal upon her future
career as a newspaper woman, and expended two cents
every morning upon the New York “Day.” But she
forgot to study it in the new interest it created: she had
just the order of mind to succumb to the fascination of
the newspaper, and she read the “Day’s” report of current
history with a keener pleasure than even the great
records of the past had induced. She longed for a
companion with whom to talk over the significant tendencies
of the age, and gazed upon Beverly Peele’s
dome-like brow with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, in the Sunday issue, she came upon a column
and a half devoted to Rosita, “The Sweetheart of
the Public,” “The Princess Royal of Opera Bouffe.”
The description of the young prima donna’s home
life, personal characteristics, and footlight triumphs,
was further embellished by a painfully <span class='it'>décolleté</span> portrait,
a lace night gown, a pair of wonderfully embroidered
stockings, and a rosary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience read the article twice, wondering why fame
realised looked so different from the abstract quality
of her imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow it seems a sort of tin halo,” she thought.
Then her thoughts drifted back to Monterey, and recalled
it with startling vividness. “Still even if I
haven’t forgotten it, it is like the memory of another
life. Its only lasting effect has been to make me
hate what is coarse and sinful; and dear auntie, even
if she hasn’t converted me, has developed all my
good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Rosita has been in love, and if that
is the reason she has forgotten me. But she hasn’t
married, so perhaps it’s only adulation that has driven
everything else out of her head.” And then with her
eyes on the river, which under the heavy sky looked
like a stream of wrinkling lead from which a coating of
silver had worn off in places, she fell to dreaming of
Beverly Peele and an ideal existence in which they
travelled and read and assured each other of respectful
and rarefied affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the winter the influenza descended upon
America. Mr. Peele, his wife wrote, was one of the
first victims, and the entire family took him to Florida.
One night, a month later, Miss Tremont returned from
Hog Heights and staggered through her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she moaned, as Patience rushed forward
and caught her in her arms, “I feel so strangely.
I have pains all over me, and the queerest feeling
in my knees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the grippe,” said Patience, who had read its
history in the “Day.” She put Miss Tremont to bed,
and sent for the doctor. The old lady was too weak
to protest, and swallowed the medicines submissively.
She recovered in due course, and one day slipped out
and plodded through the snow to Hog Heights. She
was brought home unconscious, and that night was
gasping with pneumonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no lack of nurses. Miss Beale and Mrs.
Watt, who had helped to care for her during the less
serious attack, returned at once, and many others
called at intervals during the day and night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sat constantly by the bed, staring at the
face so soon to be covered from all sight. She wanted
to cry and scream, but could not. Her heart was like
lead in her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one o’clock on the second night, she and Miss
Beale were alone in the sick room. Mrs. Watt was
walking softly up and down the hall without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Tremont was breathing irregularly, and Patience
bent over her with white face. Miss Beale began to sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not terrible, terrible,” she ejaculated, “that
she should die like this, she whose deathbed should
have been so beautiful,—unconscious, drugged—morphine,
which is as accursed as whisky—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad of it. It would be more horrible to see
her suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to see her suffer—dear, dear Miss
Tremont. But she should have died in the full knowledge
that she was going to God. Oh! Oh!” she
burst out afresh. “How I envy her! It’s my only,
only sin, but I can’t help envying those who are going
to heaven. I can’t wait. I do so want to see the
beautiful green pastures and the still waters—and oh,
how I want to talk with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience flung her head into her lap and burst into
a fit of laughter.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later she went downstairs and turned up
all the lights. Mrs. Watt had gone to the next house
to telephone for the undertakers. When she returned
she went upstairs to Miss Beale. Patience could hear
the two women praying. That was the only sound in
the terrible stillness. She paced up and down, wringing
her hands and gasping occasionally. Her sense of
desolation was appalling, although as yet she but half
realised her bereavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she heard the sound of runners on the
crisp snow. They stopped before the gate. She ran
shuddering to the window. The moon flooded the
white earth. Two tall black shadows came down the
path. They trod as if on velvet. Even on the steps
and porch they made no sound. They knocked as
death may knock on a human soul, lightly, meaningly.
Patience dragged herself to the door and opened it.
The long narrow black men entered and bent their
heads solemnly. Patience raised her shaking hand,
and pointed to the floor above. The men of death
bowed again, and stole upward like black ghosts. In a
few moments they stole down again and out and away.
Patience rushed frantically through the rooms to the
kitchen, where she fell upon Ellen, dozing by the fire,
and screamed and laughed until the terrified woman
flung a pitcher of water on her, then carried her upstairs
and put her to bed.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A week later Patience wandered restlessly about the
lonely house. The hundreds of people that had
thronged it had gone at last, even Miss Beale and
Mrs. Watt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had cried until she had no tears left, and
rebelled until reason would hear no more. Her nerves
felt blunt and worn down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday Miss Tremont’s lawyer had told her that
after a few unimportant bequests she was to have the
income of the dead woman’s small estate until she
married, after which she would have nothing and the
Temperance cause all. She was therefore exempt from
the pettiest and severest of life’s trials. Miss Tremont
had also left a letter, begging her to devote herself to
a life of charity and reform. But Patience had at last
revolted. She realised how empty had been her part,
how torrential the impulsion of Miss Tremont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great world outside of Mariaville pressed upon
her imagination, gigantic, rainbow-hued, alluring. It
beckoned with a thousand fingers, and all her complex
being responded. She longed for a talent with which to
add to its beauty, and thought no ill of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had sat up half the night thinking, and this
morning she felt doubly restless and lonely. She
wanted to go away at once, but as yet she had made
no plans; and plans were necessary. She was too
tired to go to Mr. Field and apply for work; and she
knew that her delicate appearance would not commend
itself to his approval. She went to the mirror in the
best spare bedroom and regarded herself anxiously.
Her black-robed figure seemed very tall and thin, her
face white and sharp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even red bows—” she began; then her memory
tossed up Rosita. “Oh,” she thought, “if I could
only see her,—see some one I care a little for. I
believe I’ll go—there may have been some reason—her
letters may have miscarried—I must see
somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran upstairs, put on her outing things, and
walked rapidly to the station. The sharp air electrified
her blood. The world was full of youth and hope
once more. She forgot her bereavement for the hour.
She hoped Rosita would ask her to visit her: the
popular young prima donna must have drawn many
brilliant people about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached New York she inquired her way
to “Soper’s Opera House,” obtained Rosita’s address,
and took the elevated train up town. She found the
great apartment house with little difficulty, and was
enraptured with its marble floors and pillars, its liveried
servants and luxurious elevator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly had rich ancestors,” she thought, “and
I am sure they were swells. I have a natural affinity
for all this sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was landed at the very top of the house. The
elevator boy directed her attention to a button, then
slid down and out of sight, leaving Patience with the
delightful sensation of having stepped upon a new
stratum, high and away from the vast terrestrial cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A trim French maid opened the door. She stared
at Patience, and looked disinclined to admit her. But
Patience pushed the door back with determined hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to see La Rosita,” she said in French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But madame is not receiving to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will see me, I am sure. Tell her that Miss
Sparhawk is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman admitted her reluctantly, and left her
standing in an anteroom, passing between heavy
portières. Patience followed, and entered a large
drawing-room furnished with amber satin and ebony:
a magnificent room, heavy with the perfume of great
baskets of flowers, and filled with costly articles of
decoration. The carpet was of amber velvet. Not a
sound of street penetrated the heavy satin curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An indefinable sensation stole over Patience’s
mind, a ghost whose lineaments were blurred, yet
familiar. She felt an impulse to turn and run, then
twitched her shoulders impatiently, and approaching
other portières, parted them and glanced into the
room beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evidently a boudoir, a fragrant fairy-like
thing of rose and lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a deep chair, clad in a <span class='it'>robe de chambre</span> of rose-coloured
silk, flowing open over a lace smock and petticoat,
lay Rosita. Her dense black hair was twisted
carelessly on top of her head and confined with a
jewelled dagger. One tiny foot, shod in a high-heeled
slipper of rose-coloured silk, was conspicuous on a low
<span class='it'>pouf</span>. The flush of youth was in her cheek, its scarlet
in her mouth. The large white lids lay heavily on the
languorous eyes. In one hand she held a pink cigarette
in a jewelled holder. She spoke in a low tantalising
voice to a man who sat before her, leaning eagerly
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid had evidently not succeeded in gaining
her attention. Patience, conquering another impulse
to run, pushed the hangings aside and entered. Rosita
sprang to her feet, the blood flashing to her hair; but
her eyes expanded with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita! Patita!” she stammered, then caught Patience
in her arms. As both girls looked as if about
to weep, the man hurriedly departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls hugged each other as of old; then Rosita
divested Patience of her wraps and told the astonished
maid to take them out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you are here, you shall stay,” she
said, “stay a long, long while. Have you had luncheon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—but I’m not—yes, I am, though, come to
think of it. Get me something to eat. Rosita, how
good it is to see you again! Why, why didn’t you
write to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O—h; I will tell you, perhaps; but you must
have luncheon first. I take a late breakfast, just after
rising, so it will be a few minutes before yours is ready.”
She rang a bell and gave an order to the maid, then
pushed Patience into the deepest and softest chair in
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said, smiling affectionately, “lie back
and be comfortable; you look tired. Oh, Patita, I am
so glad to see you. Isn’t it like old times?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a grace which long practice had made a fine
art, she sank upon one end of a divan, and back among
a mass of cushions. Her white arms lay along the
pillows in such careless wise as to best exhibit their
perfection; her head dropped backward slightly, revealing
the round throat. The attitude was so natural
as to suggest that she had ceased to pose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stared at her, wondering if it could be the
same Rosita. All the freshness of youth was in that
beautiful face and round voluptuous form, but she
looked years and years and years older than the Rosita
of Monterey. Patience suddenly felt young and foolish
and green. The world that had been so great and
wonderful to her imagination seemed to have shrunken
to a ball, to be tossed from one to the other of those
white idle hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has changed you so?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita gave the low delicious laugh of which Patience
had read in the New York “Day.” She relit her cigarette
and blew a soft cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you after luncheon. You are the only
person I would never fib to. I believe those grey eyes
of yours are the only honest eyes in the world. Why
are you in black?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience told her, and was drawn on to speak of
herself and her life. Rosita shuddered once or twice,
an adorable little French shudder, and cast upward her
glittering hands, whose nails Patience admired even
more than their jewels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dios de mi alma!</span>” she cried finally. “What an
existence!—I cannot call it life. I should have jumped
into the river. That life would drive me mad, and I
do not believe that it suits you either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with a Spanish accent, and with the affected
precision of a foreigner that has carefully learned the
English language. Her monotony of inflection was
more effective than animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it doesn’t,” said Patience, “and I have no
intention of pursuing it. I’m going to be a newspaper
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita gave forth a sound that from any other throat
would have been a shriek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A newspaper woman! And then you will come
and interview me. How droll! I shall have to become
eccentric, so that I can furnish you with ‘stories,’ as
they call them. I have been pumped dry. When the
newspaper women have run out of everything else they
come to me, and they love me because I am good-natured,
and turn my things upside down for them. I
never refuse to see them, so they have never written
anything horrid about me. Oh, I can tell you I have
learned a great many lessons since I left Monterey.
But here is your luncheon. While you are eating it I
will do something for you that I have never done for
any one else off the stage: I will sing to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid placed a silver tray on a little table, and
while Patience ate of creamed oysters and broiled partridge,
Rosita sang as the larks of paradise may sing when
angels awake with the dawn. Once Patience glanced
hastily upward, half expecting to see the notes falling in
a golden shower. When she expressed her admiration,
Rosita’s red lips smiled slowly away from the white
sharp little teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like it, Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>?” she asked with bewitching
graciousness. “Yes, I can sing. I have the
world at my feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She resumed her languid attitude on the divan.
“<span class='it'>Bueno</span>,” she said, “now I am going to tell you all
about it. People are always a little heavy after eating;
I waited on purpose. But you must promise not to
move until I get through. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Patience, uncomfortably. “I hope it is
nothing very dreadful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That all depends upon the way you look at things.
It will seem odd to tell it to you. You used to be the
one to do what you felt like and tell other people that
if they did not like it they could do the other thing;
but I suppose you are W. C. T. U’d.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not. Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will.” She paused and laughed lightly.
“Funny world. We do not usually tell this sort of
story to a woman, but you and I are different. <span class='it'>Bueno.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to Paris and studied hard. Yes, I am lazy
yet, but I had made up my mind to be a great, great,
great success. I had what in insane people is called
the fixed idea, and the American in me conquered the
Spanish. Everybody praised my voice. No one said
it was the greatest voice in the world, nor even better
than two or three others over there; but I had no discouragement.
I attracted a great deal of attention
from men, but the <span class='it'>dueña</span> never let them get a word
with me, and I did not care. I used to wonder at the
stories told about some of the other girls, and did not
half understand. Two sold themselves; but why? with
a fortune in one’s throat. Others fell in love, and
talked about the temperament of the artist, but I could
not understand that nonsense either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bueno</span>, at the end of the time Soper came over
and bought me eight trunks full of the most beautiful
clothes you ever saw,—mostly for the stage, but lots
for the house and street. He said I was a first-class
investment, and worth the outlay. When he heard me
sing he shook all over. I ought to tell you that I had
been kept on short allowance, and had had very dowdy
clothes, which broke my heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bueno</span>, we came home. On the steamer, Soper
treated me like a father, but never let me talk to a
man. Either he or the <span class='it'>dueña</span> was at my heels all the
time. He is a coarse-looking man, but I really liked
him because he had been so good to me, and there
was something very attractive about him. When we
reached New York the <span class='it'>dueña</span> left us. She said she
was going straight to Philadelphia to her home. Soper
and I got in another cab and drove to an apartment
on Broadway. I did not know until the next day that
it was his apartment. That was in the evening. The
next morning, while I was at a late breakfast, he sent
me a note, saying that he would call in an hour and have
a business talk with me. I was practising my scales
when he came in, and he clapped his hands and offered
me a chair. He drew one up for himself, and then
said in a perfectly business-like voice:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘When I ran across you I knew that you only
needed training to become a queen of opera bouffe, and
to make a fortune for some one besides yourself. I
also saw that you were going to become a beautiful
woman. I made up my mind that I would own both
the woman and the artist. Don’t look like a little
tigress—still, I’m glad you can look that way,—you
may be able to do Carmen yet. Don’t misunderstand
me. I am not a villain, merely a practical man with
an eye to beauty. I have no idea of letting you get
under the influence of any other man,—not even if
you weren’t so pretty. Let me console you by telling
you that for the sort of woman you are there is no
escape. You were made to drive men mad, and for the
comic opera stage. That sort of combination might as
well get down to business as early in the game as possible:
it saves time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Had I never discovered you, you would have
drifted from company to company, gone the pace with
nothing to show for it, and worn out your youth at
one-night stands. I saved you from a terrible fate.
You know the rest. You know what you owe me.
You have developed even beyond my hopes, but—mark
you this—I have not advertised you in any way.
You are as unknown as on the day you left California.
If you mount the high horse and say: ”Sir, you are
a villain. Go to, go to!“ I shall merely turn you
loose without your trunks. You may imagine that with
your voice and beauty you could get an engagement
anywhere. So you could—without advertising, without
an opera, and without a theatre of your own.
Every existing troupe has its own prima donna; you
would have to take a second or third rate part,—and
unquestionably in a travelling troupe. There is no
place for you in New York but the one I propose to
create. Lillian Russell practically owns the Casino,
and will, unless all signs fail, for many years. She
would not tolerate you on the same stage five minutes;
neither would any prima donna who had any influence
with her manager,—and they mostly have. Your
career would be exactly what it would have been if I
had not met you,—full of hardships and change and
racing about the country; arriving at six in the evening,
singing at eight, leave the next morning at four,
get what sleep you could on the train. That’s about
the size of it. You’d be painting inside of a year, if
not wearing plumpers. And what you’re mad at now,
you’d be looking upon as a matter of course then, and
grateful for the admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Moreover, no success is worth a tinker’s dam that
ain’t made in New York,—I think I wrote you that
on an average of once a month. If you show that you
have horse sense, and will sign a contract with me for
five years, I’ll make you the rage in New York inside
of two months. Now it is success or failure: you can
take your choice. I’ll be here to-morrow at ten.’
And he was gone before I could speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bueno</span>, after I had gotten over being fearfully
mad I sat down and thought it all over. I knew that
all he said was true. I had heard too much in Paris.
He had kept writing me that virtue paid in an actress
to keep me straight, but I had heard the opposite
about nine hundred times. <span class='it'>Bueno</span>, I was in a trap.
I had made up my mind to succeed. I had even
worked for it,—and you know how much that meant
with me. I made up my mind that succeed I would,
no matter what the price. It is one of two things
in this world,—success or failure,—and if you fail
nobody cares a hang about your virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I never was sentimental nor romantic.
Soper had made a plain business proposition in a practical
way that I liked. If he had gone on like a stage
lover it would have been much harder. And after all
I would be no worse than a society girl who sells herself
to a rich husband. So, after turning it over for
twenty-four hours—or all the time I was awake—I
concluded not to be a fool, but La Rosita, Queen of
Opera Bouffe. When he called I merely shrugged my
shoulders and said ‘<span class='it'>Bueno</span>.’ He laughed, and said I
would certainly succeed in this world; that the beautiful
woman with the cool calculating brain always got
there. So—here I am. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this recital her voice had not for one instant
broken nor hardened. She told her story in the soft
sweet languid voice of Spain; she might have been relating
an idyl of which she was the Juliet and Soper the
Romeo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stared at her with wide eyes and dry lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have never regretted it?” she asked;
“you don’t care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita raised her beautiful brows. “Regret? Well,
no, I should say not. Have I not realised my dreams
and ambition? Am I not rich and famous and happy
instead of a scrambling nobody? Regret?—No—rather.
What is more, I know how to save. A good
many of us have learned that lesson. When I have
lost voice and youth I shall be rich,—rich. We do
not end in a garret, like in the old days. And I do
not drink, and I rest a great deal—it will be a long
time before I go off. Besides, there are the beauty
doctors—Oh, no, I am not regretting. And Soper is
getting tired of me, I am happy to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience rose and went into the room where the
maid had carried her hat and jacket. It was a bedroom,
a white nest of lace and velvet. When she returned
she said: “I should like to go home and think
it over. I feel queer and stunned. You have taken me
so completely by surprise that I can hardly think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita coloured angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are shocked, I suppose,” she said with a
sneer. “I should think—” She paused abruptly.
She was still an amiable little soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience understood perfectly, and turned a shade
paler. “I told you that I did not understand how I
felt. In fact, I hardly ever know just how I feel about
anything. I suppose it is because I have the sort of
mind that is made to analyse, and I haven’t had experience
enough to know how. And I never judge any one.
Why should I? Why should we judge anybody? We
are not all made alike. I couldn’t do what you have
done, but that is no reason why I should condemn you.
That would be absurd. If any one else had told me
this story I should only have been interested—I am so
curious about everything. But you see you are the only
girl friend I ever had, and that is what makes me feel
so strangely. Good-bye;” and she hurriedly left the
room.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached home she forgot her horror of
death chambers, and went to Miss Tremont’s room and
flung herself on the bed. She did not cry—her tears
had all been spent; but she felt something of the profound
misery of the last year in Monterey. During the
intervening years she had seen little of the cloven hoof
of human nature; the occasional sin over on Hog
Heights hardly counted; creatures of the lower conditions
had no high lights to make the shadows startling.
But to-day the horror of old experiences rushed
over her; she was filled with a profound loathing of
life, of human nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, of love, in its higher sense—if it possessed
such a part—she had seen nothing; of sensuality, too
much. True, she had spent two weeks with Miss Galpin,
during that estimable young woman’s engagement;
but Miss Galpin took love as a sort of front-parlour,
evening-dress affair, and Patience had not deigned to
be interested. She had speculated somewhat over Miss
Tremont’s early romance, but could only conclude that
it was one of those undeveloped little histories that so
many old maids cherish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recalled all the love stories she had read. Even
the masters were insipid when they attempted to portray
spiritual love. It was only when they got down to
the congenial substratum of passion that they wrote of
love with colour and fire. Was she to believe that it did
not exist,—this union of soul and mind? Her dreams
receded, and refused to cohere. She wondered, with
natural egoism, if any girl of her age had ever received
so many shocks. She was on the threshold
of life, with a mass of gross material out of which to
shape her mental attitude to existing things. True, she
had met only women of relative sinlessness during these
last years, but their purity was uninteresting because
it was that of people mentally limited, and possessed of
the fad of the unintellectual. Moreover, they had their
erotism, the oddest, most unreal, and harmless erotism
the world has known in the last two thousand years;
and after all quite incidental: her keen eyes had long
since observed that the old maids were far more religious
than the married women, that the girls cooled
perceptibly to the great abstraction as soon as a concrete
candidate was approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She longed passionately for Miss Tremont. All her
old restlessness and doubt had returned with the flight
of that ardent absorbing personality. She wished that
she could have been remodelled; for, after all, the dear
old lady, whatever her delusions, had been happy.
But she was still Patience Sparhawk; she could only
be thankful that Miss Tremont had cemented her hatred
of evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose abruptly, worn out by conjectures and
analysis that led nowhere, and went out into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she said, lifting her arms, “this at least is
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ground was hard and white and sparkling. The
trees were crystal, down to the tiniest twig. They
glittered iridescently under the level rays of the sun
descending upon the Palisades on the far side of the
Hudson. The river was grey under great floating
blocks of ice. Groves of slender trees in the hollows
of the Palisades looked like fine bunches of feathers.
On the long slopes the white snow lay deep; above,
the dark steeps were merely powdered, here and there;
on the high crest the woods looked black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked rapidly up and down, calmed, as of old,
by the beauty of nature, but dreading the morrow and
the recurring to-morrows. Suddenly through those
glittering aisles pealed the rich sonorous music of the
organ. The keys were under the hands of a master,
and the great notes throbbed and swelled and rolled
through the winter stillness in the divine harmonies of
“The Messiah.” Patience stood still, shaking a little.
On a hill above the wood a large house had been built
recently; the organ must be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diamond radiance of the woods was living
melody. The very trees looked to bow their crystal
heads. The great waves of harmony seemed rolling
down from an infinite height, down from some cathedral
of light and stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ugly impressions of the day vanished. The
sweet intangible longing she had been used to know in
Carmel tower flashed back to her. What was it? She
recalled the words of the Stranger. It was long since
she had thought of him. She closed her eyes and
stood with him in the tower. His voice was as distinct
as the notes of the organ. She felt again the tumult of
her young half-comprehending mind. Was not life all
a matter of ideals? Were not the bad and the good
happy only if consistent to a fixed idea? Did she
make of herself such a woman as the Stranger had
evoked out of the great mass of small feminity, could
she not be supremely happy with such a man? Where
was he? Was he married? He seemed so close—it
was incredible that he existed for another woman.
Who more surely than she could realise the purest
ideal of her imaginings,—she with her black experience
and hatred of all that was coarse and evil? She
closed her eyes to her womanhood no longer. It
thrilled and shook her. If he would come—She
trembled a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All men were henceforth possible lovers. Unless the
Stranger appeared speedily his memory must give way
to the definite. The imperious demands of a woman’s
nature cannot be satisfied with abstractions. The ideal
which he stood for would lend a measure of itself to
each engaging man with whom she exchanged greeting.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Patience!” cried a strident voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience turned with a violent start. Ellen was a
large blotch on the white beauty of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a young lady to see you. She didn’t give
her name as I remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience followed the servant resentfully. The world
was cold and dull again. But when she recognised the
Peele coachman and footman on the handsome sleigh
before the door she forgot her dreams, and went eagerly
into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl was standing before the mantel, regarding
through a lorgnette a row of photographs. She turned
as she heard footsteps, and came forward with a cordial
smile on her plain charming face. She wore a black
cloth frock and turban which made Patience feel dowdy
as Rosita’s magnificence had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Hal,” she said, “and you are Patience, of
course. I hope you have heard as much of me as I
have of you. Dear old girl, I was awfully fond of her.
You look so tired—are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little. It is so good of you to come. Yes, I’ve
heard a very great deal of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sit down, thank you. Let’s try this sofa. I’ve
already tried the chairs, and they’re awful. But I suppose
dear old Harriet never sat down at all. I wonder
if she’ll be happy in heaven with nothing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience smiled sympathetically. “She ought to be
glad of a rest, but I don’t believe she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thought we were all heathens—dear old soul;
but I did love her. What was the trouble? We only
had one short letter from Miss Beale. Do tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Peele had an air of reposeful alertness. She
leaned forward slightly, her eyes fixed on Patience’s
with flattering attention. She looked a youthful worldling,
a captivating type to a country girl. Her voice
was very sweet, and exquisitely modulated. Occasionally
it went down into a minor key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall you do with yourself, now?” she asked
anxiously, when Patience had finished the brief story.
“I am so interested in you. I don’t know why I
haven’t called before, except that I never find time to
do the things I most care for; but I have wanted to
come a dozen times, and when we returned yesterday
and heard of the dear old girl’s death I made up my
mind to come at once. And I’m coming often. I
know we shall be such good friends. I’m so glad she
left you her money so you won’t have to work. It
must be so horrid to work. I’m going to ask mamma
to ask you to visit us. She’s feeling rather soft now
over Cousin Harriet’s death, so I’ll strike before she
gets the icebergs on. She isn’t pleasant then. I’ll
tell her you don’t wear the white ribbon yet—” She
broke into a light peal of laughter. “Poor mamma!
how she used to suffer. Cousin Harriet’s white bow was
the great cross of her life. It will go far toward reconciling
her—Don’t think that my parent is heartless.
She merely insists upon everything belonging to her to
be <span class='it'>sans reproche</span>. That’s the reason we don’t always
get along. What lovely hair you have—a real <span class='it'>blonde
cendrée</span>. It’s all the rage in Paris. And that great coil
is beautiful. Tell me, didn’t you find that Temperance
work a hideous bore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, but no one could resist Miss Tremont.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed one couldn’t. I believe she’d have roped
me in if I’d lived with her; but I’m a frivolous
good-for-nothing thing. You look so serious. Do you
always feel that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience smiled broadly. “Oh, no. I often feel
that I would be very frivolous indeed if circumstances
would permit. It must be very interesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get tired of yourself sometimes—I mean I do.
Are you very religious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not religious at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how awfully jolly. I do the regulation business,
but it is really tragic to carry so much religion
round all the time. I wonder how Cousin Harriet and
the Lord hit it off, or if they liked each other better
at a distance? I corresponded once with the brother
of a school friend for a year, and when I met him I
couldn’t endure him. Those things are very trying.
I am going to call you Patience. May I? And if ever
you call me Miss Peele you’ll be sorry. How awfully
smart you’d look in gowns. My colouring is so commonplace.
If I didn’t know how to dress, and hadn’t
been taught to carry myself with an air, I’d be just
nothing—no more and no less. But you have such a
lovely nose and white skin—and that hair! You are
aristocratic looking without being swagger. I’m the
other way. You can acquire the one, but you can’t the
other. When you have both you’ll be out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What fun it would be,” she rambled on in her
bright inconsequential way, “if Bev should fall in love
with you and you’d marry him. Then I’d have such fun
dressing you, and we’d get ahead of my cousin Honora
Mairs, whom I hate, and who, I’m afraid, will get him.
Propinquity and flattery will bring down any man—they’re
such peacocks. But I’ll bring him to see you.
You ought to have a violet velvet frock. I’d bet on
Bev then. But, of course, you can’t wear colours yet,
and that dead black is wonderfully becoming. Can I
bring him up in a day or two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Patience, smiling as she recalled her
brief periods of spiritual matrimony with Beverly Peele;
“by all means. I’ll be so glad to meet all of you. And
you are certainly good to take so much interest in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the angel of the family. Well, I must be off,
or I’ll have to dine all by me lonely. None of the
rest of the family uses slang: that is the reason I do.
May is a grown-up baby, and never disobeyed her
mamma in her life. Honora is a classic, and only
swears in the privacy of her closet when her schemes
fail. Mother—well, you’ve seen mother. As you may
imagine, she doesn’t use slang. Papa doesn’t talk
at all, and Bev is a prig where decent women are concerned.
So, you see, I have to let off steam somehow,
and as I haven’t the courage to be larky, I read French
novels and use bad words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and moved toward a heavy coat that lay on a
chair. “Well, Patience—what a funny lovely old-fashioned
name you have—I’m going to bring Bev to see
you as a last resource. I’ve tried him on a dozen other
girls, but it was no go. I’ll talk you up to him meanwhile—I’ll
tell him that you are one of the cold haughty indifferent
sort, and yet withal a village maiden. He admires
blondes, and you’re such a natural one. We’ll
come up Sunday on horseback. Now be sure to make
him think you don’t care a hang whether he likes you
or not—he’s been so run after. Isn’t it too funny? I
did not come here on matchmaking thoughts intent, but
I do like you, and we could have such jolly good fun
together. I’ll teach you how to smoke cigarettes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Miss Peele—Hal—you know—I don’t want
to marry your brother—I have never even seen him—much
as I should like to live with you—I’d even
smoke cigarettes to please you—but really—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know, of course. I can only hope for the
best, and Bev certainly is fascinating. At least he
appears to be,” and she smiled oddly; “but being a
man’s sister is much like being his valet, you know.
Would you mind helping me into this coat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate these heavy fur things,” she said petulantly.
“Oh, thanks—they don’t suit my light and airy architecture,
and I can’t get up any dignity in them at all.
I need fluffy graceful French things. You’d look
superb in velvet and furs and all that sort of thing.
Well, bye-bye,—no,—<span class='it'>au revoir</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took Patience’s face between her hands and
lightly kissed her on either cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be lonesome,” she said. “I’d go frantic in
this house. Can’t I send you some books? I’ve a lot
of naughty French ones—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Patience, abruptly, “I don’t want
them. Don’t think I’m a prig,” she added, hastily, as
a look of apprehension crossed Miss Peele’s face; “but
I had a hideous shock to-day, and I don’t want to read
anything similar at present—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, tell me about it. How could you have a shock
in Mariaville?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t. It was in New York—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, was it real wicked? Did you have an adventure?
Do tell me—Well, don’t, of course, if you don’t
want to, only I’m so interested in you. Well, I must,
must go;” and despite the furs she moved down the
walk with exceeding grace. As she drove off she
leaned out of the sleigh and waved her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” thought Patience, “I’m so glad she came.
It was like fresh air after a corpse covered with sachet
bags.” And then she went to the mantel and gazed
upon Beverly Peele.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Sunday came Patience dressed herself with unusual
care. It did not occur to her that people in
different spheres of life arose at different hours, and
she expected her guests any time after eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course she must wear unrelieved black, but after
prolonged regard in the becoming mirror of the best
spare room, she decided that it rather enhanced her
charms, now that a week’s rest had banished the circles
from her eyes and cleared her skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had coiled her soft ashen hair loosely on the top
of her head, pulling it out a little about her face—she
wore no bangs. Her restless eyes were dark and clear
and sparkling, her mouth pink. She carried her slender
figure with a free graceful poise. The carriage of
her head was almost haughty. Her hips had a generous
swell. Her hands and teeth were very white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly have a look of race,” she thought, “if
I’m not a beauty. I’d give a good deal to know that
my ancestors really did have good blood in their veins.
I don’t care so much for money, but I’d like to be sure
of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast she wandered about restlessly. She
had known few moments of peace since Miss Peele’s
visit. The train had been fired, and her being was in a
tumult. Beverly Peele, the Stranger, and the vague
ideals of her earlier girlhood were inextricably mixed.
The result was a being before whom she trembled with
mingled rapture and terror. Her vivid imagination
had evoked a distinct entity, and the love scenes that
had been enacted between the girl and this wholly satisfactory
eidolon were such as have time out of mind
made life as it is seem a singularly defective composition
to the wondering mind of woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At times she was terrified at the rich possibilities of
her nature, so little suspected. The revelation gave
her vivid comprehension of woman’s tremendous power
for sacrifice and surrender, possibilities of which she
had read with much curiosity, but little sympathy. For
those women she felt a warm honour, a fierce desire to
espouse their cause. For Rosita she had only loathing
and contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not only passion that was awake. Sentiment,
that finer child of the brain, and the sweet faint feeling
which assuredly lingers about the region of the heart,
whatever its physical cause may be, were there in full
measure to lend their potent lashings to that primeval
force which is as mighty in some women as in some
men. It is doubtful if a woman ever loves a man when
in his arms with the same exaltation of soul and passion
which she feels for that creation of her brain that he
little more than suggests, and that is only wholly hers
when the man himself is absent. Imagination in
woman is as arbitrary as desire in man, and she is
beaten down and crushed by this imperious and capricious
brain-imp so many times in her life that the
wonder is she is not driven to the hopes and illusions of
religion, or to humour, long before the skin has yellowed
and the eye paled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the imagination has full sway, when the
man has not been beheld, when he has been invested
with every quality dear to the heart of the generously
endowed woman, when, indeed, all eidola blend, and
she has a confused vision of an immense and mighty
force bearing down upon her which shall sweep every
tradition out of existence and annihilate the material
world, then assuredly man himself would do well to
retire into obscurity and curse his shortcomings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was four o’clock, and she had been through the
successive stages of hope, despair, hope, melancholia,
hope, and resignation, before she heard the sharp clatter
of hoofs on the road. She ran to the dining-room
window, her heart thumping, and peered through the
blind. They were coming! Hal sat her horse like a
swaying reed, but the young man on the large chestnut
rode in the agonised fashion of the day. He was of
medium height, she saw, compactly and elegantly built,
and the beauty of his face had defied the photographer’s
art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience ran to the kitchen and told Ellen to answer
the bell immediately, then sat down by the stove to
compose herself. She was still trembling, and wished
to appear cold and stately, as Hal had recommended.
When Ellen returned and announced the visitors, she
sprang up, patted her hair, pulled down the bodice of
her gown, and then, with what dignity she could muster,
went forth to meet her fate. She did wish she had
a train. It was so difficult to be stately in a skirt that
cleared the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she entered the parlour Mr. Peele was standing
by the opposite door. His riding gear was very becoming.
Patience noted swiftly that his eyes were a spotted
brown and that his mouth pouted under the dark
moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal came forward with both hands extended. “We
have come, you see,” she said, “and we had to make a
wild break to do it—had a lot of company; but I
was bound to come. Patience, this is Beverly. He’s
quite frantic to meet you. It was all I could do to
keep him away until to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man bowed in anything but a frantic
manner, and stood gracefully until the girls were seated.
Then he took a chair and caressed his moustache,
regarding Patience attentively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind if Bev smoked?” asked Hal.
“He is just wild for a cigar. We had to ride so hard
to keep warm that he didn’t have a chance, and he’s
a slave to the weed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience glanced swiftly at the door, half-expecting
to see the indignant wraith of Miss Tremont, then,
almost reluctantly, gave the required permission. Mr.
Peele promptly lit a cigar. Patience wondered if he
would ever speak. Perhaps he did not think it worth
his while. He looked very haughty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a perfectly beautiful ride,” said Hal, in
her plaintive voice. “I’d rather be on a horse than
on an ocean steamer, and I do love to travel. You
look ever so much better than you did, Patience. You
must have needed a rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele removed his cigar. “Perhaps that was what
she had been <span class='it'>im</span>patiently waiting for,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stared at him. Her eyes expanded. Something
seemed crumbling within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bev, you do make me so tired,” said his sister.
“I tell him eighteen times a day that punning is the
lowest form of wit, but he’s incorrigible. I suppose it’s
in the blood, and I’m glad it broke out in him instead
of in me. It is well to be philosophical in this
life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you can’t help yourself—” interrupted Mr.
Peele, easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience felt it incumbent upon her to make conversation,
although her thoughts were dancing a jig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a beautiful horse,” she said to the young
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes lit up with enthusiasm. “Isn’t she a
beauty?” he exclaimed. “She’s taken two prizes
and won a race. She’s the daughter—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience doesn’t know anything about horses,”
interrupted Hal. “What does she care whose daughter
Firefly is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m very much interested,” faltered Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you really?” cried Mr. Peele, with a smile so
beautiful that Patience caught her breath. “I’ve got
the rarest book in the country on horses—beautiful
pictures—coloured—I’ll bring it up and explain it to
you. Tell you a lot of stories about famous horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to ride a pony, but I haven’t been on a
horse for so long I’ve almost forgotten what it’s like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too bad. There’s nothing like it. Makes
you feel so good. When I have dyspepsia I just jump
on Firefly, and I’m all right in less than no time. I
take a canter for dyspepsia—although I can’t—er—always
feel at home that way. Ahem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience wanted to tear her hair. It was with an
effort that she kept her face from convulsing with disgust.
She caught sight of the young man’s intellectual
brow, and, without any premonitory consciousness,
laughed aloud. Mr. Peele smiled back with the
pleasure of appreciated wit, and resumed his cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bev isn’t such a fool as he looks,” remarked Hal,
airily. “Just have patience with him. We all have
our little failings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sat as if turned to clay. She could not
talk. All her natural animation had deserted her. She
wished they would go and leave her alone. But Hal
pulled off her riding gloves, and made herself comfortable
on the sofa. As she rattled on, Patience noticed
how beautiful her nails were. She turned her own
hands over so that the palms lay upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said young Peele, in a low tone.
“They’re much prettier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” cried Hal. “What are you blushing
about, Patience? How lovely it is to blush like
that. I’ve forgotten how—and I’m only twenty-two.
There’s tragedy for you. It’s not that I’ve had so
many compliments about my beauty, nor yet about my
winning ways,—which are my strong point,—but I
found so much to blush about when I was first launched
upon this wicked world that I exhausted my capacity.
And Bev always did tell such naughty stories—” She
paused abruptly. “Dear me! perhaps I’ve made a
bad break, and prejudiced you against my brother;
and I want you to be good friends so that we can have
jolly times together. Perhaps you have an ideal man—a
sort of Sir Galahad. I haven’t sounded you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Galahad is not my ideal,” said Patience,
with the quick scorn of the woman who is born with
intuitive knowledge of man. “I could not find anything
interesting in an elongated male infant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Hal. “Give me the man
of the world every time. I tell you, you appreciate the
difference when you have to entertain ’em. And the
elongated infant, as you put it, never understands a
woman, and she has no use for that species whatever.
He doesn’t even want to understand her, and a woman
resents that as a personal insult. The bad ones hurt
sometimes, but they’re interesting; and when you learn
how to manage them it’s plain sailing enough. Mrs.
Laurence Gibbs—a friend of mamma’s, awfully good,
goes in for charity and all that sort of thing—said the
other day that at the rate women were developing and
advancing, the standard of men morally would have to
be raised. But I said ‘Not much!’ that the development
of woman meant that women were becoming
more clever, not merely bright and intellectual, and
that clever women would demand cleverness and fascination
in man above all else; and that Sir Galahads
were not that sort. It’s experience that makes a man
interesting to us women,—they represent all we’d like
to be and don’t dare. If they were like ourselves—if
they didn’t excite our imaginations—we wouldn’t
care a hang for them. Mrs. Gibbs was horrified, of
course, and told me I didn’t know what I was talking
about. But I said I guessed it was the other way.
I’m not clever—not by a long sight,—and if I can’t
stand a prig I know a clever woman can’t and won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad I’m not a prig,” murmured Mr.
Peele.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re a real devil. If you were clever now,
you’d have to be shut up to protect society; but as it
is, you just go on your good looks, so you’re not as
dangerous as some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rattled on, not giving the others a chance for
more than a stray remark. Patience, listening with deep
curiosity to this new philosophy, became aware of an
increasing desire to turn her eyes to the man that had
so bitterly disappointed her. A direct potent force
seemed to emanate from him. It was her first experience
of man’s magnetism, but she knew that he possessed
it to a remarkable degree. When he finally
shot out an insignificant remark she felt, in the excuse
it gave her to turn to him, a sensation of positive relief.
He was leaning back in his chair, in the easy
attitude of a man that has been too accustomed to
luxury all his life to look uncomfortable in any circumstances.
With his picturesque garb, his noble, beautiful
face, his subtle air of elegance and distinction, he
looked the ideal hero of girlhood’s dreams. Patience
wondered what Nature had been about, then recalled
the many tricks of that capricious dame made famous
in history, the round innocent faces of the worst boys
in the Loyal Legion class, the saintly physiognomy
of a Mariaville minister who had recently fallen from
grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peele was watching her out of his half-closed eyes,
and as she met them he smiled almost affectionately.
Patience averted her head quickly, angry that she had
felt an impulse to respond, and fixed her attention on
Hal. “Dear old Cousin Harriet,” that young woman
was remarking, “how I do wish that I were even
sorrier than I am that she is dead. I try to think it’s
because I saw so little of her; but I know it’s just
because I’m so beastly selfish. I don’t care a hang
for anything that doesn’t affect my own happiness—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not selfish,” interrupted Patience, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I am,” said Miss Peele, with a comical
little air of disgust which sat as gracefully upon her as
all her varying moods and manners. “I get up thinking
what I can get out of the day, and I go to bed glad
or mad according to what the day has done for me. I
don’t go in for Church work like Honora—dear
Honora!—nor am I always doing some pretty little
thing for people like May. I suppose you think I’m
an angel because I came to see you. I assured myself
at great length that it was my duty—but it was plain
curiosity, no more nor less; and now I like you awfully,
better than any woman I ever met—and I do so want
you to come and visit us, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you come and stay with me?” asked
Patience, hurriedly. She had no desire to visit Mrs.
Gardiner Peele. “You know you have more or less
company, and I should be very quiet for a while.
And oh! I should so like to have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’d love to! I’ll come and stay a week. I’m
so sick of the whole family, Bev included. We won’t
be going anywhere for three months out of respect for
Cousin Harriet—mamma is very particular about those
things—and I can get away as well as not. I’ll come
on Tuesday,—can I? Bev will come up occasionally
and see how I’m getting on—won’t you, Bevvy, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d much rather you would not be here,” said Mr.
Peele, calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—really—well, we’re all young yet. I’m
coming all the same. I suppose we must be going.
We have to get home to dress for dinner, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose, and drew on her gloves. Her brother stood
up immediately and helped her into her covert coat.
“Well, Patience,” she said, kissing her lightly, “you’ll
see me on Tuesday. I’ll come by train, and wire you
beforehand. Mamma’ll raise Cain, but I’ll manage it.
It’s only occasionally she’s too much for me. The cold
glare of those blue eyes of hers freezes my marrow at
times and takes all the starch out of me. It’s awful to
have been brought up under that sort of eye. When
Honora marries it’s the sort of eye she’ll have. She
cultivates the angelic at present. Have I talked you to
death, Patience? So good of you to ask me to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peele held out his hand, and Patience could do no
less than lay hers within it. As it closed she resisted
an impulse to nestle her own more closely into that
warm grasp. He held her hand longer than was altogether
necessary, and she felt indignantly that she had
no desire to draw it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do for one day,” said Hal, drily. “Come
along, Beverly Peele. We won’t get home for coffee at
this rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gone Patience threw herself on the
sofa and burst into tears, then laughed suddenly. “I
feel like the heroine of a tragedy,” she thought. “And
the tragedy is a pun!”</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Hal arrived on Tuesday afternoon. Patience for
twenty-four hours after Beverly Peele’s visit looked
upon life through grey spectacles. She had an impression
of being a solitary figure on a sandy waste,
illimitable in extent. Life was ugly practical reality.
It frightened her, and she cowered before it, hating the
future, her blood chilled, her nerves blunt, her brain
stagnant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by Tuesday morning, being young and buoyant,
she revived, and roamed through the woods, entirely
loyal to the Stranger. She made up her mind that she
would find him, that he could not be married. He
must have waited for her. “Oh!” she thought, “if I
could not believe that something existed in this world
as I have imagined it, some man good enough to love
and look up to, I believe I’d jump into the river. At
least I have heard Him talk. He could not be a
disappointment, like that hollow bronze. If there are
many men in the world like Beverly Peele I don’t
wonder women are in revolt. Women start out in life
with big ideals of man, and if they are disappointed I
suppose they unconsciously strive to make themselves
what they should have found in man. But it is unnatural.
It seems to me that man must be able to
give woman the best she can find in life, whether
he does or not. Something in civilisation has gone
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been so restless,” she said to Hal, as the girls
sat on the edge of the bed in the spare room, holding
each other’s hand. “If you had not been coming I’d
have gone to New York before this and seen Mr. Field,
the editor of the ‘Day’—He promised me once he’d
make a newspaper woman of me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?” cried Hal. “What on earth do you
want to be a newspaper woman for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be something. I couldn’t live out of
Mariaville on my income, and the few hundred dollars
Mr. Foord left me, and I don’t know of anything else
I want to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to be Mrs. Beverly Peele,” said Hal,
definitely. “Beverly has the worst attack of my recollection.
He has simply raved about you. Tell me,
don’t you like him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal leaned forward and turned Patience’s face about.
“Don’t you like him?” she asked in a disappointed
tone. “Tell me. Please be frank. I hate people who
are not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll confess it—I was disappointed in him.
You see, I’d thought about him a good deal—several
years, if you want to know the truth—and I was sure
he was an intellectual man—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal threw back her head and gave a clear ringing
laugh. “Bev intellectual! That’s too funny. I don’t
believe he ever read anything but a newspaper and
horse literature in his life. But we all think he’s bright.
I think it my duty to tell you that he has a fearful
temper. He’s always been mamma’s pet, and she never
would cross him, so he flies into regular tantrums when
things don’t go to suit him; but on the whole he’s
pretty good sort. Don’t you think he’s good-looking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wonderfully,” said Patience, glad to be enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m sure you’ll like him when you’ve forgotten
the ideal and got used to the real. Do please try
to like him, for I’m bent on having you for a sister-in-law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll try,” said Patience, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have no idea,” continued the astute Miss Peele,
“how many girls have been in love with him. I’ve
known girls that looked like marble statues—the
marble statue with the snub nose; that’s our swagger
New York type, you know,—well, I’ve seen them
make perfect idiots of themselves about him. But so
far he’s rather preferred the ladies that don’t visit at
Peele Manor. I’ve brought some cigarettes. Can I
smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can just do anything you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Well, I think I’ll begin by lying down
on this soft bed. It’s way ahead of the chairs and sofa
in the parlour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She exchanged her frock for a <span class='it'>peignoir</span>, and extended
herself on the bed. Patience sat beside her in a rocking
chair, her troubles forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” said Hal, suddenly removing her
cigarette, “what was the shock you had the other day?
Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will,” and Patience told the story of Rosita
from beginning to end. Hal listened with deep
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a stunner,” she said, “and worth coming to
Mariaville for. The little rip. She didn’t tell you half.
I’ll bet my hopes of a tiara on that. But she does
dance and sing like an angel. And so you were children
together? How perfectly funny! Now tell me your
history, every bit of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience hesitated, then impulsively told the story,
omitting few particulars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Peele’s cigarette was allowed to go out. “Well,
well,” she said, when Patience had finished. “Fate
did play the devil with you, didn’t she? I’m so glad
you’ve told me. I’ll tell the family what I like, and
you keep quiet. I have the inestimable gift of selection.
You poor child! I’m so glad you fell in with Cousin
Harriet; and now you are going to be happy for the
rest of your life. Oh, it’s so good to be here in this
quiet place. I’m so tired of everybody. Sometimes
I get a fearful disgust. The same old grind, year after
year. If I could only fall in love; but when I do I
know it’ll be with a poor man. I never did have any
luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you marry him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal shook her wise young head. “I don’t know.
You never can tell what you’ll do when you get that
disease; but I do know that I’d be miserable if I did.
Money, and plenty of it, is necessary to my happiness.
You see we’re not so horribly rich. Papa gives mamma
and May and me two thousand dollars each a year, and
his income comes mostly from his practice. We haven’t
anything else but a little house in town, and Peele Manor—which
of course we’ll never sell—and a big farm adjoining.
Bev runs that, and has the income from it—about
three thousand dollars a year. When he wants
more mamma gets it for him, and when he’s married of
course he’ll have a lot more. Two thousand stands me
in very well now, but as a married woman I want nothing
under thirty thousand a year—and that’s a modest
ambition enough. You can’t be anybody in New York
on less. Oh, dear—life is a burden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your woes are not very terrible,” said Patience,
drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’d think so if you were me. We suffer
according to our capacities and point of view. What
is comedy to one is tragedy to another. If I had to
wear the same clothes for two seasons I’d be as miserable
as a defeated candidate for the Presidency. Beer
makes one man drunk and champagne another. Bev,
by the way, never drinks. He’s rather straight than
otherwise. What’s your ideal of a man, by the way?
Of course you have an ideal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Patience, vaguely. “A
man with a big brain and a big heart and a big
arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Peele laughed heartily. “You are not exacting
in your combinations, not in the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week passed delightfully to Patience, although
Hal became rather restless toward the end. She
arranged Patience’s hair in six different fashions,
then decided that the large soft coil suited her best.
Patience’s nails were manicured, she was taught how
to smoke cigarettes, and select extracts from French
novels were read to her. Hal was an accomplished
gossip, and regaled her hostess with all the whispered
scandals of New York society. She was a liberal
education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly did not call, nor did he write, and Hal
anathematised him freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have my ideas on the subject,” she said
darkly. “Just you wait.”</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of Hal’s departure, as Patience was
braiding her hair for the night, there was a sharp ring
at the bell, and a few moments later Ellen came upstairs
with a card inscribed “Mr. Beverly Peele.”
Patience felt disposed to send word that she had retired,
so thoroughly had she lost interest in the young
man; but reflecting that he had probably ridden
ten miles on a cold night to see her, told Ellen to light
all the burners in the parlour, and twisted up her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she went downstairs she saw a heavy overcoat on
the hall table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it had occurred to me that he had come by
train,” she thought, “I’d have let him go home
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came forward with his charming smile, looking
remarkably handsome in his evening clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was kind of you to come,” she said, too unsophisticated
to feel embarrassed at receiving a man at
night in a house where she lived alone with a servant.
“Of course you knew how lonely I must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal is good company, isn’t she?” he asked, holding
her hand and staring hard at her. “But I should
think she’d miss you more than you’d miss her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience withdrew her hand abruptly. Her face
wore its accustomed cold gravity, contradicted by the
eager eyes of youth. “Won’t you sit down? I hope
Hal has missed me, but she has hardly had time to tell
you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t she? She has had several hours, and I
suppose you know by this time how fast she can talk.
She’s awfully bright, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t a beauty like May, nor intellectual like
Honora, but you can’t have everything—that is,
everybody can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does any one?” asked Patience, indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal says you are the cleverest woman she has ever
met,—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid Hal is carried away by the enthusiasms
of the moment,” said Patience, as he paused. She was
highly gratified, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—you are the prettiest woman I ever saw,” he
continued, as if she had not spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nonsense!” exclaimed Patience, angrily, but
the colour flew to her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean it,” and indisputably his eyes spoke admiration.
“I’ve thought of no one else since I was here.
I haven’t come before, because there’s nothing in calling
on your sister, and that’s what it would have
amounted to. But, you see, I’m here the very night
she left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very flattering.” Patience was beginning
to feel vaguely uncomfortable. She realised that the
lore gathered from novels was valueless in a practical
emergency, and longed for the experience of Hal. “I
understand that you are considered fascinating, and
I suppose most women do like to be flattered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never paid a woman a compliment before in my
life,” he said, unblushingly. “You don’t look a bit like
any woman I ever saw. Hal says you look like a
‘white star on a dark night,’ and that’s about the size
of it. You have such lovely hair and skin. I’ve
always rather admired plump women, but your slenderness
suits you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please talk about something else! I am not
used to such stuff, and I don’t like it. Suppose you
talk about yourself.” (She had read that man could ever
be beguiled by this bait.) “Are you as fond of travel
as Hal is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never travel,” he said shortly. “When I find
a comfortable place I stay in it. Westchester County
suits me down to the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say that you can travel and don’t?
that you don’t care at all to see the beautiful things in
Europe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my mother always brings home a lot of photographs
and things, and that’s all I want of it. I
never could understand why Americans are so restless.
I’m sick of the very sound of Europe, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New York is the centre of the earth, and full of
pretty—interesting things, dontcherknow? I’ve had
some gay times there, I can tell you. But I’ve
settled down now, and prefer Westchester County to
any place on earth. I’d rather be behind or on
a horse than anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you care for society?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate it. One winter was enough for me. Wild
horses wouldn’t drag me into a ball-room again. Of
course when the house is full of company in summer
I like that well enough. I play billiards with the men
and spoon—flirt with the girls and the pretty married
women; but I’m just as contented when they’ve all
cleared out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say that you stay in the country
by yourself all winter? What do you do? Read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-o-o-o. I don’t care much about books. We
have a big farm and I run it, and I skate and drive
and ride and smoke—Oh, there’s plenty to do.
Occasionally I go to town and have a little fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call fun if you don’t like society,—the
theatre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The theatre!” he laughed. “I never sat out
a play in my life. Oh, I don’t know you well enough
to tell you everything yet. Sometime, I’ll tell you
a lot of funny things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you enjoy the newspapers in winter,” said
Patience, hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I read even the advertisements. The papers
are all the reading any man wants. There are two or
three good sensational stories every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t read those,” said Patience, disgustedly.
This idol appeared to be clay straight up to his hair.
“I like to read the big news and Mr. Field’s editorials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you need educating. I read those too—not
Field; he’s too much for me. But I didn’t come
here to talk about newspapers—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you smoke a cigar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks. I smoked all the way down, and in
the cab too, for that matter—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the horses standing out there in the cold?
Wouldn’t you like to tell him to take them to the
barn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he can look after his own horses.
They’re nothing but old hacks, anyhow.” He leaned
forward abruptly and took her hand, pressing it closely.
“Oh!” he said. “I’ve been wild to see you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience attempted to jerk her hand away, acutely
conscious of a desire to return his clasp. She did the
worst thing possible, but the only thing that could be
expected: she lost her head. “I don’t like you to do
that,” she exclaimed. “Let me go! What do you
mean, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you are the loveliest woman I ever saw. I
have been wild about you—” He had taken her
other hand, and his face was close to hers. He had
lowered his lids slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think that because I am alone here you
can say what you like?” she cried passionately. “You
would not dare act like this with one of your mother’s
guests!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wouldn’t I?” He laughed disagreeably. “But
what is the use of being a goose—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sprang to her feet, overturning her chair:
but she only succeeded in pulling him to his feet also;
he would not release her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would leave the house,” she said, stamping
her foot. “If you don’t let me go, I’ll call Ellen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t make a goose of yourself. And I’m not
afraid of a servant. I’m not going to murder you—nor
anything else. Only,—do you drive all men wild
like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything about men,” almost sobbed
Patience, “and I don’t want to. Will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t.” He released her hands suddenly;
and, as she made a spring for the door, flung his arms
about her. She ducked her head and fought him, but
he kissed her cheeks and brow and hair. His lips
burnt her delicate skin, his powerful embrace seemed
absorbing her. She was filled with fury and loathing,
but the blood pounded in her ears, and the very air
seemed humming. The man’s magnetism was purely
animal, but it was a tremendous force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a brute, a beast!” she sobbed. “Let me
go! Let me go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t,” he muttered. He too had lost his head.
“I’ll not leave you.” He strove to reach her mouth.
She managed to disengage her right arm, and clinching
her hand hit him a smart blow in the face. He laughed,
and caught her hand, holding it out at arm’s length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen!” she cried. As she lifted her head to call
he was quick to see his advantage. His mouth closed
suddenly on hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room swam round her. She ceased to struggle.
Her feet had touched that nether world where the
electrical forces of the universe appear to be generated,
and its wonder—not the man—conquered her. She
shook horribly. She felt a tumultuous impulse to spring
upon her ideals and beat them in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavy footfalls sounded in the kitchen hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is Ellen!” she gasped, wrenching herself
free. The man stamped his foot. He looked hideous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go!” said Patience. “Go, just as fast as you can,
and don’t you ever come here again. If you do, it
won’t do you any good, for you’ll not see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she ran upstairs and locked her door loudly.</p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For some time she walked rapidly up and down, pressing
her hands to her hot face. Chaos was in her. She
could not think. She only felt that she wanted to die,
and preferred the river. She poured water into a
basin and plunged her face into it again and again.
The water had the chill of midwinter, and sent the
blood from her brain; but she felt no cleaner. Still,
her brain was no longer racing like a screw out of water,
and she sat down to think. It was her trend of mind
to face all questions with the least possible delay, and
she looked at herself squarely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” she thought, “I am the daughter of Madge
Sparhawk, after all. The horror of that night left me
as I was made. Three years with the best woman the
sun ever shone on only put the real me to sleep for a
time. All my ideals were the vagaries of my imagination,
a sort of unwritten book, of the nature of those
that geniuses write, who spend their leisure hours in
debauchery. I am no better than Rosita. I have not
even the excuse of love—if I had—if it had been
Him—I might perhaps—perhaps—look upon passion
as a natural thing. Certainly it is not disagreeable,” and
she laughed unpleasantly. “But I despised this man.
He has not the brain of a calf nor the principle of a
savage, and yet it is he that made me forget every ideal
I ever cherished. If I met Him now, I would not
insult him with the gift of myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Beverly Peele came in here now I verily believe
that I should kiss him again. What—what is human
nature made of? I have the blood of refined and enlightened
ancestors in my veins—I know that. I have
seen nothing of sexual sin that did not make me abhor
it. Barring my mother, I had the best of influences in
Monterey, and I knew the difference. I have—or had—a
natural tendency toward all that was refined and
uplifting. I was even sure I had a soul. My brain is
better, and better furnished, than that of the average
woman of my age. And yet, at the first touch, I
crumble like an old corpse exposed to air. I am simply
a body with a mental annex, and the one appears
to be independent of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the world all vile?” she continued, resuming
her restless walk. “This man attacked me as if he
had no anticipation of a rebuff. And yet I am the
friend of his sister, the adopted daughter of his
mother’s cousin, and, he has every reason to think,
of irreproachable life. If the world—his mother’s
world—were not full of such women as he imagined
me to be—he would never have taken so much for
granted. He acted as if he thought me a fool, and I
appear to be remarkably green. I am certainly learning.
Oh—the brute! the brute!” And she flung
herself on the bed and burst into violent weeping, which
lasted until she was so exhausted that she fell asleep
without disrobing.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning her head ached violently. She
started for the woods, but turned back. They held her
lost ideals. She sat all day by the window, looking
at the Hudson, listless, and mentally nauseated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the afternoon a special messenger brought a
note of abject apology from Beverly Peele. She burnt
it half read and told the man there was no answer.
There is only one thing a woman scorns more than a
man’s insult, and that is his apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day he called, but was refused admission
by the sturdy Ellen. Patience spent the day on Hog
Heights. On the following day he called again, with
the same result. The next day Hal came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the row between you and Bev?” she
exclaimed, before she had seated herself. “He says
you’ve taken a dislike to him, and is in the most
beastly temper about it. I never saw him so cut up.
He’s sent me here to patch it up and give you this
letter. Do tell me what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Patience, grimly. “The
idea of his sending his sister to patch it up!” And she
gave an account of Mr. Peele’s performance, woman-like
omitting her own momentary forbearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal listened with an amused smile. “So Bev made
a bad break,” she remarked when Patience had concluded.
“I’m not surprised, for he’s pretty hot-headed,
and head over ears in love. You mustn’t
take life so tragically. I’ve had several weird experiences
myself, although I’m not the kind that men lose
their head about as a rule; only given the hour and
the occasion, some men will lose their head about any
woman. Perhaps I should have said New York men.
They are a rare and lovely species. They admire God
because he made himself of their gender and knew
what he was about when he invented woman. I was
out on a sleighing party one moonlight night last winter,
and on the back seat with a man I’d never seen out of
a ball-room before. The way that man’s legs and
arms flew round that sleigh made my hair curl. You
see, a lot of us are fast, but then plenty of us are not.
The trouble is that the men can’t discriminate, as we
look pretty much alike on the outside. They’re not a
very clever lot—our society men—and they don’t
learn much until they’ve been taught. Then when
they are forced to believe in your virtue they feel
rather sorry for you, and later on are apt to propose—if
you have any money. Bev would propose to you if
you were living in a tent and clad in a gunny sack.
He would have preferred things the other way—it’s
so much less trouble—but as he can’t, he won’t stop at
any such trifling nuisance as matrimony. Oh, men are
a lovely lot! Still, the world would be a pretty stupid
place without them. You’ll learn to manage them in
time, and then they’ll only amuse you. They are not
really so bad at heart—they’ve been badly educated.
I know four married women of the type we call ‘friskies,’
whom my mother would shudder at the thought of
excluding from her visiting list, and whom I’d bet my
new Paquin trunk, several men I know have had affairs
with. So what can you expect of a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the world rotten?” asked Patience, in disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just about half and half. I know as many
good women as bad. Half the women in society are
good wives and devoted mothers. The other half,
girls and married women, old and young, are no better
than your Rosita. Sometimes their motives are no
higher. Usually, though, it’s craving for excitement.
I don’t blame those much myself. The most fascinating
woman I know is larky. She as much as told me so.
Some of the confessions I’ve had from married women
would make you gasp. Well—let’s quit the subject.
Promise me you’ll forgive Bev.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not. I hate him. I shall never look at
him again if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, dear, you are young! And I do so want
you for a sister. May is such a fool, and I do hate
Honora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t have me loathe myself for the sake
of being your sister, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I wouldn’t have you marry Bev if you
couldn’t like him; but I believe you really do, only
things haven’t turned out as you planned in that innocent
little skull of yours. Bev is a good fellow, as men
go. You’ll get used to him and his kind in the course
of time, and then you’ll enjoy life in a calm practical
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no other way?” asked Patience, bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in my experience. And if you stay here in
your woods you’ll get tired of your ideals after a while.
You can’t live on ideals—the human constitution isn’t
made that way. If it was there’d be no such thing as
society. We’d live in caves and bay the moon. So
you’d better come into the world, Patience dear, and
accept it as it is, and drain it for all it’s worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hush! You are too good to talk like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good?—what is good? I am the result of my
surroundings—a little better than some, a little worse
than others. So was Cousin Harriet. So is La Rosita.
I’m not cynical. I merely see life—my section of
it—exactly as it is. If you become a newspaper
woman you’ll probably receive a succession of shocks.
As nearly as I can make out they’re about like us—half
and half. I became quite chummy with a newspaper
woman, once, crossing the Atlantic. She was
awfully pretty, and, as nearly as one woman can judge
of another, perfectly proper. She related some wild
and weird experiences she had had with men. Yours
would probably be wilder and weirder, as you appear
to be possessed of an unholy fascination; and in a year
or two you’ll be a beauty. All you want is a little more
figure and style—or rather clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if I’m to have wild and weird experiences I
prefer to have them with men of brains, not with a lot
of empty-headed society men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t generalise too freely, my dear. There are
newspaper men and newspaper men,—according to
this girl I’ve just told you of. Some are brainy, some
are merely bright; some are gentlemen, most are
common beyond words. And, as she said—after
you’ve worked with man in his shirt sleeves, you don’t
have many illusions about the animal left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not one, and I lost them in an hour. Your
brother is supposed to be a gentleman with a long
array of ancestors, and he acted like a wild Indian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, he merely lost his head. That was a
compliment to you, and you should not be too hard on
a man in those circumstances. He won’t do it again,
I’m sure of that. He has some control. I warned
him before he came not to pun, and he says he didn’t,
not once. Now, tell me one thing—Don’t you like
him just a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patience; but she flushed to her hair,
and Hal, with her uncanny wisdom, said no more.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Patience went to the woods for the
first time since Beverly Peele’s onslaught. A natural
reaction had lifted her spirits out of the slough, and she
turned to nature, as ever. She could never be the same
again, she thought with a sigh; and once more she
must readjust herself. She wondered if any girl had
ever done so much readjusting in an equal number of
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods were no longer a scene of enchantment.
The ice had melted. The trees were grey and naked
again. The ground was slush, and nasty to walk upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the spring must come in time,” she thought;
“and then perhaps I’ll feel new too—but not the
same, for like the spring I shall have other seasons
behind me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—perhaps—who knows?—I may be the better
for knowing myself. I was in a fool’s paradise
before. Perhaps I was in danger of becoming an
egoist, and imagining myself made of finer fibre than
other women. Great writers show that the same brute
is in all of us, and I can believe it. Some work it off
in religion, but the majority don’t. There seems to be
some tremendous magnetic force in the Universe that
makes the human race nine-tenths Love—for want of
a better name. Circumstances and ancestors determine
the direction of it. It seems too bad that Civilisation
has not done more for us than to give us the
analytical mind which understands and rebels, and no
more, at the inheritance of the savage. But now that
I know myself, perhaps I can go forward more surely
on the path to the higher altitudes of life. I should
like to be as good as auntie, and worldly-wise beside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose my horrid experience with this man will
make me more exacting with all men. I think I could
not blunder into matrimony, as some women do. I feel
as if I never wanted to see another man, but that
impression will pass—all impressions appear to pass.
I may even want to meet Him after a time, and perhaps
he will forgive. Shouldn’t be surprised if he’d want
a good deal of forgiveness himself. Meanwhile I can
work, and learn all I can of what life means, anyway.
I’ll go to Mr. Field—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft ground echoed no footfalls, but Patience
suddenly became aware that some one was approaching
her. She turned, and saw Beverly Peele.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='book3'></a>BOOK III</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“I do hope you’ll make a hit, Patience,” said Hal,
regarding her critically. “The public, even the little
public of a garden party, is a thing you can’t bet on,
but you certainly are stunning. If ever papa loses his
fortune, in the curious American way, I shall follow the
ever seductive example of the English aristocracy and
go in for dressmaking. That frock is a triumph of art,
if I do say it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience revolved slowly before the Psyche mirror
which stood between two open windows in one corner
of Hal’s pretty terra-cotta bedroom. She too was
pleased with the airy concoction of violet and white.
On a chair lay a picture hat, another bird of the same
feather. Hal placed it on Patience’s head, a little
back, and the violet velvet of the interior made a very
effective frame for the soft ashen hair and white skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly carry yourself well,” continued Hal,
“and before long you will acquire an air. Always
keep in mind that <span class='it'>that</span> is the most important thing in
life—our life—to acquire. But you look like a lily,
a purple and white forest lily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t the faintest idea what to talk to fashionable
people about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too clever—don’t frighten the men and
antagonise the women. You see, you’re not known at
all, so people won’t begin by being afraid of you—as
they would if they knew all that went on in that pretty
skull of yours. Just be Mrs. Beverly Peele. Nobody
would ever suspect Bev of marrying a clever woman.
You can’t do the artless and infantile, like May: your
face is too strong; but you can be unsophisticated,
and that always goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not unsophisticated!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t look like that. All the light seems to
go out of your skin. I mean give everybody the impression
that you have everything to learn, and that
each, individually, can teach it all. It’s awfully fetching.
That is what has made May’s success. Of course
you wouldn’t be another May, if you could; but you
want to begin at the beginning—don’t you know?
You must let society feel that it gives you everything, tells
you everything. Then it will love you. But if it suspects
that you are alien—the least little bit—then there
will be the devil to pay. Of course a few of the best
sort would like you, but I’m set on your making a hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ll never take,” said Patience, with a
sigh, “but I am wild to see Vanity Fair, all the same.
It must be great fun—all that brilliancy and life.
But somehow I don’t feel in tune with the people I
have met, so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s natural. You are not acclimatised yet,
so to speak. Society is a distinctly foreign country to
those that have not been brought up in it. Just sit
down on the edge of that chair and rest while I take a
look at myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White is certainly my day colour,” she continued,
revolving in her turn before the mirror. “It is wonderful
how it clears the skin, especially with a touch of
blue near the face. Pink would make me as yellow as
October, and green would suggest thirty-five. Your
grey matter will be spared the wear and tear of The
Study of Colour, but if I hadn’t reduced it to a fine
art, I’d have had to turn literary or something when
May came out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look just like a fairy! I never saw anything
so dainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course; I’m so little and light that I have to
work the fairy racket for all it’s worth. It’s a heavenly
day, isn’t it? The country’s got its best spring clothes
on, sure enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls leaned out of each of the windows in turn,
scrutinising the grounds. In front and on both sides
of the house the land rolled away in great irregular
waves. Woods were in the sudden hollows, on the
lofty knolls; between, shelving expanses of green, bare
but for an occasional oak or elm. Beside the driveway
was a long narrow avenue of elms, down which two
might pace shoulder to shoulder, and no more. In a
deep hollow on the right was the orchard, a riot of
pink and white. The immediate grounds were small
and trim, and fragrant with the flowers of civilisation;
out on the hills beyond the wild-flowers and tall grass,
the locust and hawthorn, had their way. Behind all
flowed the Hudson under the green Palisades, its surface
gay with sail and steamboat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dancing booth had been erected on one of the
lawns, and the musicians were already assembling under
the silken curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks very well,” said Hal, “and you couldn’t
have a more perfect day for your <span class='it'>début</span>. Not that I
care much for garden parties; the fresh air makes me
sleepy, and there’s no concentration, as it were—as
there is in a ball-room, don’t you know? But mamma
decreed that the world should make your acquaintance
out of doors, and that is the end of it. I wonder if you’ll
manage to induce Bev to go to town for the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so! It will be horribly dull to stay here all
winter, with all of you away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s an edifying sentiment for a bride of three
months. However, I agree with you. I’d go mad
shut up in a country house in winter with the most
fascinating man that ever breathed. And the dickens
of it is, mamma always takes his part, whether he’s
wrong or right. She’ll preach wifely duty to you until
you’d live on a desert island to get rid of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard her,” said Patience, gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wondered if that was what she was at in the
library yesterday. When mamma has her chin well up
and her lower lip well out I can tell at long range that
she’s embracing the cause of virtue. But she tackled
you rather early in the game, considering you haven’t
made any notable break as yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t go driving with Beverly yesterday,—the
sun makes my head ache,—and I’d also begged
him to take me to the theatre to see Rosita, and he
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ll never get Bev to the theatre. We’ll
go by ourselves to a matinée. However, it’s better than
being a newspaper woman on several dollars a week—come
now, own up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I enjoyed Florida and New Orleans and Canada
immensely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a tremendous concession for Bev to
make—he detests travelling. He certainly is in love;
but I imagine he expects you to live on that same concession
for some time to come—thinks it’s your turn
to do the self-sacrificing act. Such is man. Anyhow,
I’m glad it’s all turned out so comfortably, and that you
are here, and that all is settled—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to ask you something. I couldn’t get it
out of Beverly. Did your mother make a very violent
objection to his marrying me? Of course I am a social
nobody, and she must have made great plans for her
only son. She didn’t say anything when she came to
call; but, you see, she didn’t call until three days
before the wedding, and Beverly’s and your excuses
were not very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course she raised Cain,” said Miss Peele,
easily; “that was to be expected. But papa put his
foot down and said he was glad to have Beverly marry
a clever woman: it might be the making of him. And
<span class='it'>I</span> just fought! Of course I’d told papa that you were
as high bred as any woman in America, and that you’d
look a swell in less than no time. That weighed heavy
with him, for, in his opinion, God may have made himself
first, but he made the Peeles next, and no mistake.
And Bev! He went into the most awful tantrums you
ever saw. I think that was what brought mamma
round—she was afraid he’d burst a blood-vessel.
When she wrote and asked Miss Beale to live with you
I knew the day was won. And now that you are Mrs.
Beverly Peele she’ll respect you accordingly, although
you’ll have some lively tussles. But make her think
you adore Bev, and you’ll pull through. Suppose we
go down now. Tra-la-la! I wish it were over.”</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The girls descended the twisted stair into the wide
hall. All the doors and windows were open, and the
soft air blew through the great house, lifting the lace
and silken curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl, looking like a large butterfly, in her yellow
frock, was fluttering about the hall amidst the palms
and the huge vases of flowers. Her skin was of matchless
tints, her large blue eyes as guileless as those of an
infant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” she cried, as Hal and Patience reached
the first landing, “how perfectly sweet! Hal, is my
frock all right in the back? My things never fit quite
as well as yours do. Isn’t Patience too fetching for
words? I wish I was just white like that. How perfectly
funny that we should be giving a garden party for
Bev’s wife! Who would have thought it last year?
Isn’t it odd how things do happen? And hasn’t
Honora been perfectly lovely about it? I always knew
she didn’t care. I wonder if any decent men will
come up! It’s so hard—Hal, <span class='it'>does</span> my frock wrinkle
in the back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no,” drawled Hal, without looking at her.
She glanced at the tall clock in an angle. “They’ll
be here in ten minutes, now—Oh—h—h!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A portière was pushed aside, and a girl entered the
hall from a dark background of books and heavy curtains.
She was far above the ordinary height of woman,
and extremely slender. Golden hair clustered about a
long face, pale rather than white. The large azure eyes
had the extraordinary clarity of childhood, and an
expression of perfect purity. The nose was long, the
mouth thin, but well curved and very red. She wore a
clinging gown of white crêpe and a large knot of blue
wild-flowers at her belt. She moved slowly forward,
managing her long limbs with much dexterity, but
could hardly be called graceful. Patience thought her
the most beautiful woman she had ever seen, and murmured
her admiration to Hal, who snorted in a gentle,
ladylike way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will be here in a moment, I suppose,” said
Honora, wearily. “I think I shall not go out. I’ll
stay in the drawing-room and entertain the older people.
Some one must attend to them, and I really prefer the
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are always so amiable,” said Hal, drily, “and
you certainly won’t get freckled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true that I don’t like freckles,” said Honora,
calmly, “and I do like the older people. Even you,
when you have a few white hairs, may become more or
less interesting. Patience, dear, you look very lovely.
You must let me kiss you.” She bent her cool lips to
the brow of the bride, swaying over her. Her voice
could not be described by any adjective devoid of the
letter L. It was liquid, silvery, cold, light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly is a stunning-looking woman,” said
Hal, as Honora passed into the drawing-room, “but
she’s a whole rattlesnake, and no mistake. I’ve never
seen her strike real hard yet; she merely spits occasionally,
and always in that amiable way. You can
imagine how subtle she is, and what a dangerous force
such self-control is. I shall never understand how she
failed to get Bev.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, as May suggests, she didn’t want him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, didn’t she! Just wait! you’ll hear from her
yet. There’s the whistle. The train’ll be here in
three minutes. Let us group ourselves gracefully under
Peele the First.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went into the large white drawing-room, whose
old-fashioned woodwork was as it had been nearly three
hundred years ago, even to the heavy shutters over the
small-paned windows. The ceiling was fretted with
floral designs, executed in <span class='it'>papier mâché</span>, surrounding a
<span class='it'>bas relief</span> of “our well beloved Whyte Peele,” who had
received the grant of these many acres from James the
First. All the woodwork was painted white, and carved.
The furniture, modern, but of colonial design, was upholstered
in pale pink and blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond a side hall was a long dining-room panelled
to the ceiling in oak, and hung on all sides with dead
and living Peeles. The carved oaken table was spread
with the light unsubstantial feast of the modern time.
Adjoining the dining-room were two small reception-rooms
looking upon the terrace at the back of the
rambling old house. In the middle of this hall, under
the carved twisted stair, was a round enclosure whose
door opened upon a well, from whence a secret passage
led to the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Peele swept across the hall from the dining-room,
and raising her lorgnette, considered Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look very well,” she said, coldly. “Don’t get
nervous, please; it is the one thing for which people
have no toleration. Where is Beverly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has gone for a drive. You know he does not
like entertainments.” Patience’s nerves were muttering,
and her mother-in-law’s admonition was not of the
nature of balm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Peele raised her brows. “It is odd that a bride
should have so little influence over her husband,” she
remarked; and Patience was now in that equable frame
of mind which carries one through the severe ordeals
of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How she did live through that ordeal of introduction
to some five hundred people she never knew. Fortunately,
all but the neighbours arrived on the special
train which had been sent for them, and there was little
for her to do but smile and bend her head as Mrs.
Peele named her new daughter-in-law to her guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whatever might be that exalted dame’s private
opinion of her son’s choice, whatever methods she
might employ in untrammelled domestic hours to make
her disapproval felt, to the world she assumed her habitual
air of being supremely content with all that pertained
to the house of Peele. Had Patience been the daughter
of a belted earl she could not have been presented to
New York with a haughtier pride, a calmer assumption
that New York must embrace with gratitude and enthusiasm
this opportunity to meet the daughter-in-law of
the Gardiner Peeles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her manner gave Patience confidence after a time.
Her own pride had already conquered diffidence; and
trying as the long ordeal was, she thrilled a little at the
sudden realisation of half-formed ambitions. There
was no taint of the snob in her; some echo-voice of
other generations lifted itself out of the inherited impressions
which had moulded her brain cells, and protested
against its descendant ranking below the first of
the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the guests were politely indifferent to the
honour provided for them; the girls stared at her in a
manner calculated to upset any <span class='it'>débutante’s</span> equilibrium;
but the gracious kindness of others and the languid
admiration of the men kept her in poise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbours arrived shortly after the train, and it
was an hour before the greater part of the company
had dispersed over the grounds, and Patience could sit
down. Mrs. Peele remained in the drawing-room with
some eight or ten people, and as Hal and May had
both disappeared, Patience stayed with her mother-in-law,
not knowing where to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought the girls very forbidding with their pert
noses and keen eyes, although she admired their luminous
skin and splendid grooming, striking even in the
airy attire of spring. The older women looked as if
they would patronise her did Mrs. Peele withdraw her
protecting wing, and one man, passing the window,
inserted a monocle and regarded her deliberately.
Suddenly Patience experienced a sensation of profound
loneliness. No force in life is surer of touch than the
subtle play of spirit on spirit, and Patience read that
these people did not like her and never would, that
they recognised the alien who would regard their world
spectacularly, never acquire their comic seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of golf, Mrs. Peele?” asked one girl,
languidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never have played golf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl raised her brows. “Really! Are you fond
of tennis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never played tennis.” Patience repressed
a smile as the girl looked frankly shocked. Still the
guest was evidently determined to be amiable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you don’t think it frivolous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I should like to learn all those things very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Miss Peele can teach you. She is awfully
clever at all those things. Don’t you think Miss Mairs
looks like Mary Anderson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary Anderson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the actress, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never seen her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was visibly embarrassed. Another, who
looked as if harbouring a grin in her straight little
mouth, came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do think Mr. Peele is so good-looking,” she
exclaimed, with a fine show of animation. “We all
think you are to be congratulated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience smiled at the frank rudeness of this remark,
and said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Amy Murray was wild about him. She’s
not here to-day, I notice. We did think it too bad
that he wouldn’t go out. Some of the girls have met
him here, but I never have. They say he is awfully
fascinating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he is fascinating,” said Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been doing with yourself if you
have never learned to golf nor play tennis?” asked
another girl, insolently. She was a tall girl, with a
wooden face, a tight mouth, and an “air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I read, mostly,” said Patience, with an extremely
bored air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother of the third girl turned swiftly and
smiled at the bride, a humorous smile in which there
was some pity. Patience had observed her before.
She was a tall woman with a slender figure of extreme
elegance. Her dark bright face was little older than
her daughter’s. Her ease of manner was so great that
it was almost self-conscious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, say!” she exclaimed, “don’t think we’re all
like that. The girls don’t have much time to read—that’s
true—but after they settle down they do, really.
Hal reads French novels—the little reprobate!—We
read French novels too, but a lot else besides. Oh,
really! Outsiders—the people that only know society
through the newspapers, don’t you know?—misjudge
us terribly, really. Some of the brightest women of
the world are in New York society—why shouldn’t
they be? And if the girls don’t study it’s their own
fault; they certainly have every opportunity under the
sun. I was made to study. My father was old-fashioned,
and had no nonsense about him. I always say I was
educated beyond my brains, but I’d rather have it
that way than the other. Now, I assure you I read
everything. I have a standing order on the other side
with an English and a French book-seller, to send me
every book the minute it attracts attention—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re real intellectual, you are,” drawled
Hal’s mocking voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady turned with a start and a little flush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hal!” she cried gaily, “how you do take the
starch out of one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got enough to stock a laundry, so you
needn’t worry. I’ve come to rescue my fair sister-in-law
before you talk her to death. Come, Patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience arose with alacrity, and followed her out of
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like her?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, immensely. She’s as bright as a woman can
be who has so little time to think about it. She’s a
tall and majestic pillar of Society, you know, and she
carries it—the intellect, not the pillar—round like a
chip on her shoulder. That makes me weary at times.
I’ve heard her talk for an hour without stopping. The
only thing that makes me forgive her is her slang. We
have a match occasionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her daughter doesn’t look as if she used slang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she doesn’t. She’s no earthly use whatever.
Are you enjoying yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not particularly. But it’s a lovely scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawns, and knolls, and woods were kaleidoscopic
with fashionettes in gay attire, shifting continually.
There were not men enough to mar the brilliant effect.
The music of birds soared above the chatter of girls,
the sound of wood and brass. The river flashed away
into the distance, a silver girdle about Earth’s green
gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, very pret,” said Hal. “But come, I’m going
to introduce you to my latest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t tell me that you had a latest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve only met him a few times—he’s from Boston.
I expect I forgot about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking over the lawns toward the Tea
House, a long low rustic building which stood on the
edge of the slope. A hubbub of voices floated through
the windows, peals of laughter, affected shrieks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot of my intimates are there,” said Hal. “I’ve
managed to get them together. May is doing the
hostess act with her accustomed grace and charm, and
I’m taking a half hour off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went round to the front of the house and
entered. It was an airy structure of polished maple.
Little tables, each with a delicate tea-service, were
scattered about with artistic irregularity; round the
wall ran a divan, luxurious, but not too low for whaleboned
forms. On this the girls were stiffly lounging.
The men were more at their ease. All were smoking,
the girls daintily, but firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal! Hal! sweet Queen Hal!” cried one of the
young men, rising to his feet. “I’ve been keeping
this place—directly in the middle—for you. See, it
shall be a throne.” He piled three cushions atop, and
with exaggerated homage led her forward amidst the
ejaculatory applause of the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Norry too witty?” said one girl to Patience, as
she made room for her, “and so original! Whoever
else would have thought of such a thing?—although
Hal ought to be a queen, don’t you think so? We
just rave about her. Do you smoke? try my kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, thankful that at last she could do something
like these people, accepted the cigarette. During
her three months’ trip she had not smoked, as Beverly
thought it shocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Wynne,” cried Hal, suddenly, “come over
here and talk to my sister-in-law. Patience, this is
the young man from Boston, famous as the only New
Englander whose ancestors did not come over on the
‘May Flower.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man with a smooth serious face rose from his
cushions and came forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully good-looking,” murmured the girl who had
proffered the cigarette, “and wonderfully smart, considering
he’s not a New Yorker. It’s too bad he’s so
beastly poor, for he’s terribly <span class='it'>épris</span> with Hal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man, who had paused a moment to speak
with Hal, inserted himself as best he could between
Patience and her new acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are here,” murmured the bride.
“You do not look quite at home, and I am not,
either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled with instant sympathy. “Oh, I don’t
care very much for society, and I don’t like to see
women smoke. It’s an absurd prejudice to have in
these progressive days, but I can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you don’t like to see Miss Peele smoke,”
said Patience, mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed, then laughed. “Well, perhaps that is
it. They are all charming, these girls, but there is
something about Miss Peele that distinguishes her.
Did you ever notice it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. She is herself, and these others are
twelve for a dozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it.” He glanced about at the girls in their
bright gowns, which clung to their tiny waists and hips,
their narrow chests and modest busts, with the wrinkleless
perfection that has made the modern milliner the
god he is. Their polished skin and brilliant shallow
eyes, their elegant sexless forms, their haughty poise
and supercilious air, laid aside among themselves but
always in reserve, their consciousness of caste, were
the several parts of a unique and homogeneous effect,
which, Patience confided to Mr. Wynne, must mark
out the New York girl in whatever wilds she trod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it does,” he said. “The New York girl is <span class='it'>sui
generis</span>, and so thoroughly artificial a product that it
seems incredible she can exist through another generation.
I will venture to predict that the species will be
extinct in three, and that American women of a larger
and more human type will gradually be drawn into New
York, and found a new race, so to speak. Why, it
seems to me that the children of these women must
be pigmies—imagine one of those girls being the
mother of a man. It is well that New York is not
America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily Patience’s eyes wandered to Hal. Her
waist was as small, her figure as unwomanly as the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” said Wynne, answering her thought;
“but she is so charming that one is quite willing she
should do nothing further for the human race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience burst into a light laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It suddenly struck me—the almost comical difference
between these girls and the ‘Y’s,’ and the ‘King’s
Daughters.’ It does not seem possible that such types
can exist within ten miles of each other. I should
explain that I have passed the last three years in a
country town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is odd how religion holds its own in those small
places. It is opera, theatre, balls, Browning societies,
everything to those people shut out of the manifold distractions
of cities. Religion seems to be the one excitement
of the restricted life. Human nature demands
some sort of emotional outlet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you two talking about?” cried
the girl on the other side. “Will you have another
cigarette, Mrs. Beverly?—that is what we shall all call
you, you know. Mr. Wynne, please talk to me a while.
Isn’t this Tea House too sweet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is more,—it is angelic,” said Wynne, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you’re guying!” Even her voice pouted.
“Oh! please shake those ashes off my gown—quick!—thanks.
Oh, your eyes are grey. I thought they
were brown. I’m afraid of grey eyes, aren’t you, Mrs.
Beverly—Oh, dear! your eyes are grey too. What
ever shall I do?” and she cast up her hands. Even
her sleek hair seemed to quiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the misfortune of the American race to run to
grey eyes,” said Wynne. “Habit should have steeled
you by this time—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he made a pun! he made a pun!” cried the
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not!—I beg pardon, but I never did such
a thing in my life,” cried Wynne, indignantly; and
Patience felt suddenly depressed, although she too had
found a friend in habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal rose while the girl was lisping mock apologies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to go,” she said. “Isn’t it hateful? But
I must go and do my duty. Patience, you must
come too. Why are you blocking the doorway, Mr.
Wynne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? Well, bye-bye;” and the three went off,
followed by a gentle chorus of regrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, my dear,” said Hal, “there is a group
of people over there looking hideously bored. You
go and cheer them up, while I do my duty by those
austere and venerable dames who are staring through
their lorgnettes at the dining-room windows—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hal, I can’t! Don’t send me to those people
alone. What can I say to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, my dear, this is a world of woe. One
day you will be châtelaine of this place and be giving
garden-parties on your own account, so you’d better
take the kindergarten course, and be thankful for the
chance. Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience walked unwillingly over to a group of four
women seated under a drooping oak. She had forgotten
the names of nine tenths of the guests, but she
recognised Mrs. Laurence Gibbs, a plain rather dowdy
little woman with sad face and abstracted gaze. Beside
her on the rustic seat was a woman who gave a
dominant impression of teeth: they fairly flashed in the
shadows. In a chair sat a woman of remarkable prettiness.
She would have been a beauty had her features
been larger, so regular were they, so sweet her expression,
so soft her colouring of pink and white and brown,
so tall and full her figure. In another chair was a
young woman of no beauty but much distinction. Her
prematurely white hair was curled and tied at the base
of her head with a black ribbon, realising an eighteenth
century effect. Her face was dark and brilliant. She
sat forward, her slim figure full of suppressed energy.
She had been talking with much animation, but as
Patience approached she paused abruptly. The pretty
woman burst into a merry laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Lafarge was just remarking what hideous
bores garden parties are,” she said audaciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you needn’t mind me,” said Patience, sitting
down on the grass, as there was no other seat. “I
quite agree with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s awfully good of you, Mrs. Peele,” said
Mrs. Lafarge, “and awfully mean of you, Mary Gallatin.
Of course this is one of the loveliest places on the
Hudson, and I love to come here; but there are not
enough men. That’s the whole trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That always seems to be the cry with you American
women,” said she of the teeth. “You have no resources.
You should be independent of men. They
seem to be of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are driven to resources in Russia,”
said Mrs. Gallatin, sweetly, “but your observation is
faulty. We are spoiled over here, and that is the reason
we grumble occasionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see we haven’t a large leisure class, as you
have,” said Mrs. Gibbs, hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really think the reason men avoid garden parties
is that they are afraid they might be betrayed into sentiment,”
broke in Mrs. Lafarge. “They do protect
themselves so fiercely. How did you ever make Tom
Gallatin propose, Mary dear? He had the most ideal
bachelor apartment in New York, and entrenched
himself as in a fortress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one or two fall by the wayside every year,
you know, and this time Gally happened to stumble
over me. Poor Gally, he told me yesterday that he
hadn’t seen me to speak to for a month. The idea
of the lower classes grumbling. I should like to know
who works as hard as we do. How do you manage to
do the society and the charity, both?” she asked of
Mrs. Gibbs. “Does Mr. Gibbs ever see <span class='it'>you</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never neglect my husband,” said Mrs. Gibbs,
sternly. “When I must neglect anything it is society.
I came to-day because I longed for a glimpse of the
country, and I have not been able to go to Woody
Cliffs yet—the poverty is so terrible this year. I wish
you would come with me sometime and see for
yourself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid! I never could stand the smells. I
give my pastor so much a year, and I really think that’s
doing one’s share. Of course if you like it, it’s another
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it!” cried the Russian. “You speak as if it
were her pastime. I cannot express how gratifying it
is to me to meet a serious woman occasionally in New
York society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a lovely time in Petersbourg,” murmured Mrs.
Gallatin. “I never met an offensive Russian inside of
the country. Poor America!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand,” said the foreigner, stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am sure you understand English—you
express yourself so clearly. We all weep over America
occasionally, you know. It is a sort of dumping ground
for foreigners,—who sit at our feet, and abuse us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One is at liberty to abuse insolence,” said the Russian,
with suppressed wrath, “and the women of New
York are the most insolent I have ever met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not among ourselves—not really. We think
it insolent in outsiders to elbow their way in—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary! Mary!” cried Mrs. Gibbs. “I hear that
you spent some years with Miss Harriet Tremont,” she
continued, addressing Patience. “She passed her
entire life in charitable work, did she not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she did, and she enjoyed it too. Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gallatin laughed softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enjoy it?” said Mrs. Gibbs. “I never have looked
at it in that way. I think it my duty to aid my miserable
fellow beings, and I am thankful that I am able to
aid them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Odd, the fads different people have,” murmured
Mrs. Gallatin. “Now mine is Russians. What is yours,
Leontine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mary, you deserve to be shaken,” exclaimed
Mrs. Lafarge, as the Russian sprang to her feet and
stalked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it. She’s a boor, and I wish she’d go
back and live with a Cossack. Foreigners are all very
well on their native heath, but as soon as they are transplanted
to this side and treated with common decency
they become intolerable. They grovel at our feet, swell
because we receive them, and sneer at us behind our
backs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you have a way of irritating them, my dear,”
said Mrs. Gibbs. “You are a very naughty girl.
Won’t you sit up here by me, Mrs. Peele? I am afraid
the ground is damp. I shall ask you some time to
explain to me Miss Tremont’s methods. I often feel
sadly at sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” said Patience, “I doubt if I know
them. I just followed her blindly. I may as well
confess it—I didn’t take a very great interest in the
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Mrs. Gallatin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry that I have made a mistake,” said Mrs.
Gibbs, stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well—you know—there is such a thing as getting
too much of anything—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there?” Mrs. Gibbs rose, and shook out her
skirts with an absent air. “I think I will go over and
talk to Mrs. Peele;” and she walked away with an awkward
gait, her head bent forward. She certainly did
not have an “air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear! dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Gallatin. “Just
think! you have lost the interest of Mrs. Laurence
Gibbs. She might have invited you to her exciting
musicales or her cast-iron dinners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t abuse her,” said Mrs. Lafarge. “She is
a harmless little soul, and does what she thinks is right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is happier too,” said Patience, her thoughts in
Mariaville. “It is odd, but they always are. I think
it’s because they’ve unconsciously cultivated the supremest
and most inspired form of egoism, and naturally
they get a tremendous amount of joy out of it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear! Hear!” cried Mrs. Gallatin. “She analyses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, you mustn’t do that out loud,” said Mrs.
Lafarge. “You’ll be a terrible failure if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be a pity, because you are so pretty,”
said Mrs. Gallatin, smiling. “I’ve been staring at
you whenever I’ve had the chance, and you don’t
know how many charming things I’ve heard said of
you this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, have you really?” asked Patience, warming instantly,
as much to the kindly sympathy as to the agreeable
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I have. That violet against your hair and
skin makes a perfect picture of you. <span class='it'>N’est-ce pas</span>,
Leontine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are both very kind,” said Patience, with
a young impulse to be frank. “I feel so out of it all.
You see this is my first experience of this sort of thing,
and some of those girls have made me feel like a
barbarian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d be glad of your freshness, not only of looks
but of mind,” said Mary Gallatin. “I should think it
would be a blessed relief to have some other sort of interest
but just this,” and she swept out her arm disdainfully.
“That’s the reason I go, go, all the time. I don’t dare
think. When you have no talent, and are not intellectual,
and not frantic about your husband, what are you
to do? There’s no other resource, in spite of that
Russian prig. I’d give a good deal to be beginning it
all again at eighteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no spice in life without violent contrasts,”
said Mrs. Lafarge. “That’s the real reason why so
many of our good young friends are larky. The
trouble with this world is that although there is variety
enough in it, each variety travels in a different orbit.
The social scheme is all wrong, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True! True!” said Mrs. Gallatin, plaintively. “But
I see they are about to eat. The open air always makes
me hungry. That is variety enough for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they crossed the lawn she laid her arm about
Patience’s waist. “Bev doesn’t like society,” she said,
“and I’m afraid you’re not in any danger of satiety;
but don’t think out loud when you are in it. Leontine
never does, do you, Leontine? And she is clever too.
It must be delightful to be clever. Heigh-ho! Well,
you must be sure to come to see me anyhow. I feel
positive we shall be friends. Come some morning at
eleven. That is just after I have had my tub and am
back in bed again. I love to see my friends then.
Oh, dear, we must scatter. There are not two seats
together anywhere. Bye-bye.”</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God they’re gone.” Hal divested herself of
her tight smart frock, got into a lawn gown, lit a cigarette,
and extended herself on the divan in her bedroom.
“Well, Patience, how did you like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I made the hit you expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-o-o-o, you didn’t exactly create a <span class='it'>furore</span>; but I
don’t know that any one could do that with so much
oxygen round: makes peoples so drowsy, don’t you
know? But you were admired awfully. And then you
are an unconventional beauty, and that always takes
longer. Now, May made a howling sensation, but people
are tired of her already. That type doesn’t wear.
My plain phiz wears much better, because there was
never any chance of reaction with me. Oh, dear, here
comes Bev.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock, and in response to Hal’s languid invitation,
Beverly entered. He was in evening clothes, and as
handsome as ever; but he looked rather sulky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might have met me when I got home,” he
said to his wife. “I haven’t seen you since luncheon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tragic!” exclaimed Hal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was so tired I just drifted in here and fell in a
heap,” said Patience, apologetically. “My skull feels
empty, and aches inside and out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t like society?” said Mr. Peele,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very much indeed! I think it is delightful,
delightful! Only the first time is rather trying, you
know. I met some charming people, and want to meet
them again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peele grunted, and lit his cigar. His eyes devoured
his wife’s fair face. Patience looked at Hal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother says you carried yourself very well,”
remarked Mr. Peele, gracefully; “that after the first
you were quite at your ease. That was one reason I
went away: I was so afraid you’d break down, or
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience flushed angrily, but made no reply. She
had learned that even a slight dispute would move her
husband to a violent outbreak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looked more to the manor born than half the
guests,” said Hal, “and if you took her out next winter
she’d become the rage—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wish my wife to be the rage! And she is
going to stay here. If she loves me as much as I love
her she’ll be as contented with my society as I am with
hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if any woman ever loved a man as much as he
loved her,” remarked Miss Peele. “I am sure Patience
is no such idiot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” cried Beverly. Patience rose hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll go and brush my hair,” she said, moving
to the door; but he sprang to his feet and stood in
front of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me!” he cried, his voice shaking. “Don’t
you love me as much as I love you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Beverly,” she said, impatiently, “how can
you get into such tempers about nothing? You have
asked me if I loved you about nine thousand times
since we were married. How am I to know how much
you love me? Have you a plummet and line about
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are dodging the question. And you have
never asked me if I loved you—not once—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience slipped past him and ran down the hall to her
room. Before she could close the door he was beside
her. He caught her in his arms and kissed her violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall always be mad about you,” he said. “And
I believe you are growing cold. You have not been
the same lately. Sometimes I think that you shrink
from me as you did at first. Tell me what I have
done. I’d sell my soul to keep you. If you are tired
of me, I’ll kill myself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disengaged herself. “Listen,” she said; “I’ve
tried to explain—but you don’t seem to understand—that
I didn’t want to fall in love with you—not in that
way. That should not come first. Then when I found
myself made of common clay, I said that I would forget
that I had ever been Patience Sparhawk, and begin life
again as Mrs. Beverly Peele. Novelty helped me; and
when one is travelling, one’s ego appears to be dissolved
into the changing scene—one is simply a sensitised
plate. But now I am beginning to feel like
Patience Sparhawk again, and it frightens me a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly, to whom the larger part of these remarks
were pure Greek, blanched to the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you regret it,” he stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say that. I only mean that I seem to
spend life readjusting myself; and that now I seem to
be all at sea again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t love me any longer! Oh, God!” and
he flung himself on the floor, and burying his face in a
chair, groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was disgusted, but his suffering, primary as
it was, touched her. Moreover, her broad vein of philosophy
was active once more. She was by no means
prepared to leave him—the tide was ebbing very slowly.
She sat down on the chair, and lifted his face to her
lap. “There,” she said, “I am sorry I spoke. You
don’t seem to understand me. If you did, though, this
scene could never have occurred. But I love you—of
course—and I do not regret it. So get up and
bathe your eyes. It is after seven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her hands, his face glowing again. The
words were all sufficient to him. “Then if you love
me you will see how happy I’ll make you,” he exclaimed.
“I’ll never leave you a minute I can help;
but if you stop loving me I’ll make life hell for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said you’d kill yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I would, but I’d get square with you first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose you go into your own room now, and
let me dress for dinner.”</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The summer passed agreeably enough. Circumstances
prevented Beverly bestowing an undue amount of his
society on his wife, and until a woman is wholly tired
of a man she retains her self respect. Moreover,
Patience chose to believe herself in love with him:
“it had been in her original estimate of herself that she
had been at fault.” She persuaded herself that she
loved him as much as she could love any man, and
she did her pathetic best to shed some glimmer of spiritual
light into a man who might have been compounded
in a laboratory, so little soul was in him. But despite
the clay which was hers, she loved it a great deal for a
time in loving it at all, for that was her nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to several other garden-parties, and found
them more amusing than her own, although the young
men that frequented them were quite uninteresting:
even Beverly scintillated by contrast, for he, at least,
had a temper; these more civilised youths appeared to
have no emotions whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peele Manor was full of company all summer. Patience
found the married men more entertaining than
the younger ones, although they usually made love to
her; but after she had outgrown her surprise and disapproval
of their direct and business-like methods, it
amused her to fence with them. They had more self-control
than Beverly Peele, and were a trifle more skilful,
but their general attitude was, as she expressed it
to Hal: “There’s no time to lose, dontcherknow!
Life is short, and New York’s a busy place. What the
deuce is there to wait for? Sentiment? Oh, sentiment
be hanged! It takes too much time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal was an accomplished hostess, and allowed her
guests little time to make love or to yawn. There were
constant riding and driving and yachting parties, picnics
and tennis and golf. In the evening they danced,
romped, or had impromptu “Varieties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was fascinated with the life, although she
still had the sense of being an alien, and moments of
terrible loneliness. But she was too much of a girl not
to take a girl’s delight in the dash and glitter and picturesqueness
of society. She was not popular, although
she quickly outgrew any external points of difference;
but the essential difference was felt and resented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole there was concord between herself and
her mother-in-law. Mr. Peele she barely knew. His
family saw little of him. He had not attended the wedding.
When Patience had arrived at Peele Manor after
her trip, he had kissed her formally, and remarked
that he hoped she “would make something of Beverly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was an undersized man with scant iron grey hair
whose tint seemed to have invaded his complexion.
His lips were folded on each other so closely, that
Patience watched them curiously at table: when eating
they merely moved apart as if regulated by a
spring; their expression never changed. His eyes
were dark and rather dull, his nose straight and fine, his
hands small and very white. He was not an eloquent
man at the bar; he owed his immense success to his
mastery of the law, to a devilish subtlety, and to his
skill at playing upon the weak points of human nature.
No man could so adroitly upset an “objection,” no
man so terrify a witness. It was said of him that he
played upon a jury with the consummate art of a great
musician for his instrument. He rarely lost a case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was very soft, his manners exquisite. He
was never known to lose his temper. His cold aristocratic
face looked the sarcophagus of buried passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He deeply resented his children’s failure to inherit
his brain, but in his inordinate pride of birth, forgave
them, for they bore the name of Peele. Hal was his
favourite, for she, at least, was bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May admired her sister-in-law “to death,” as she
phrased it, and bored her with attentions. Patience
preferred Honora, who puzzled and repelled her, but
assuredly could not be called superficial, although her
claims to intellectuality were based upon her preference
for George Eliot and George Meredith to the lighter
order of fiction, and upon her knowledge of the history
of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, as Patience was crossing the lawn in front
of the house, May called to her from the hall, beckoning
excitedly. She and Hal and Honora were standing by
a table on which was a saucer half full of what appeared
to be dead leaves. As Patience entered, May lifted the
saucer to her sister-in-law’s nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? What?” asked Patience, then paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—what a faint, delicious, far-away perfume,” she
said after a moment. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May dropped the saucer and clapped her hands.
Hal laughed as if much gratified. Honora’s eyes wandered
to the landscape with an absent and introspective
regard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Patience again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s dried strawberry leaves,” said May.
“Don’t you know that they say in the South that you
can’t perceive their perfume unless every drop of
blood in your veins is blue? The common people
can’t smell it at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience blushed and moved her head disdainfully,
but she thrilled with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you come up and see my room?” said
Honora, softly. “You’ve never called on me yet, and
I think I have a very pretty room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll be delighted,” said Patience, who was
half consciously avoiding Beverly: Peele Manor was
without guests for a few hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you must tell me if you like my room as much
as you do me,” said Honora, who looked more like an
angel than ever, in a white mull frock and blue sash.
Her manner to Patience was evenly affectionate, with
an undercurrent of subtle sadness and reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she opened the door of her room, Patience
exclaimed with admiration. The ceiling was blue,
frescoed with golden stars, the walls with celestial
visions. A blue carpet strewn with lilies covered the
floor, fluttering curtains of blue silk and white muslin,
the old windows. From the dome of the brass bedstead
mull curtains hung like clouds. A faint odour of
incense mixed with the sweet perfumes of summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not beautiful?” said Honora, in a rapt voice.
“It makes me think of heaven. Does it not you? It
was dear Aunt Honora’s last Christmas gift to me. It
was so sweet of her, for of course I am only the poor
cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience looked at her, wondering, as she had often
done, whether the girl were a fool, or deeper than any
one of her limited experience. Honora rarely talked,
but she had reduced listening to a fine art, and was a
favourite in society. Whether she had nothing to say,
or whether she had divined that her poverty would
make eloquence unpardonable, Patience had not determined.
One thing was patent, however: she managed
her aunt, and her wants were never ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said softly, “I am going to show you
something that I don’t show to every one—but you are
dear Beverly’s wife.” She folded a screen and revealed
an altar covered with cloth of silver, antique candlesticks,
and heavy silver cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My faith which sustains me in all the trials of life,”
whispered Honora, crossing herself. “Ah, if I could
have made dear Beverly a convert. Once he seemed
balancing—but he slipped away. I have tried to win
Hal and May to the true faith too; but we were always
so much more to each other—Beverly and I,—playmates
from childhood. I think I know him better than
anybody in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience felt an interloper, a thief and an alien, but
out of her new schooling answered carelessly: “Oh,
he is awfully fond of you, but I don’t think he is inclined
to be religious. This room is too sanctified to
speak above a whisper in. Come to my room and talk
to me awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora opened a door by the head of her bed, and
they passed through a large lavatory, then through
Beverly’s room to that of the bride, a square room
whose windows framed patches of Hudson and Palisade,
and daintily furnished in lilac and white. A
photograph of Miss Tremont hung between the windows.
On one side were shelves containing John
Sparhawk’s library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly arose from a deep chair, where he had been
smoking and glowering upon the Hudson. Patience
caught Honora firmly by the waist and pushed her into
the most comfortable chair in the room, then with much
skill engaged her in a discussion with Beverly upon the
subject of music, the one subject besides horse which
interested him.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In August the girls went to Newport, and Patience became
very tired of her mother-in-law. May returned
engaged to a wealthy Cuban, who had been dancing
attendance on her blondinitude for some months past,
and Mrs. Peele became so amiable that she forgot to
lecture her daughter-in-law or irritate her with the large
vigilance of her polaric eyes. The girls left again for
Lenox and Tuxedo. On the first of January the family
moved to their town house for the winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was alone with her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the first three days of this new connubial
solitude it snowed heavily. Beverly could not ride nor
drive, and wandered restlessly between the stable and
the library, where his wife sat before the blazing logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some two thousand volumes at Peele
Manor. Patience had had no time to read since her
marriage, but on the morning of the family’s departure
she made for the library, partly in self defence, partly
with pleasurable anticipation. She hoped that Beverly
would succumb to the charms of the stable, where there
were many congenial spirits and a comfortable parlour;
but she had barely discovered Heine’s prose and had
read but ten pages of the “Reisebilder,” when the door
opened, and he came in. She merely nodded, and went
on reading. She was barely conscious of his presence,
for Heine is a magician, and she was already under his
spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you might shut up your book and talk to
me,” said Beverly, pettishly, flinging himself into a
chair opposite her. “This is a nice way to treat a
fellow on a stormy day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you read too,” murmured Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I will not. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience closed the book over her finger and looked
at him impatiently. Then an idea occurred to her, and
she spoke with her usual impulsiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Beverly,” she said, “you and I have to spend
many months alone together, and if we are to make
a success of matrimony we must be companions, and
to be companions we must have similar tastes. Now
I’ll make a bargain with you: I’ll try to like horses if
you’ll try to like books. On pleasant days I’ll ride and
drive with you, and when it storms we’ll read together
here in the library. I am sure you will like it after a
time. If you find it tiresome to read to yourself I’ll read
aloud. I don’t mind, and then we can talk it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Beverly. “Anything you say.
What’s that you’re reading now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heine’s prose. He is wonderful—such a style and
such sardonic wit, and such exquisite thoughts. I’ll
begin all over again. Now light a cigar and make
yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a half hour she read aloud, and then Mr. Peele
remarked,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it! The skating is spoiled for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Beverly, you haven’t been listening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t like it very much. He skips around
so. Besides, I always did hate Germans. Give me
America every time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, read something American then,” said Patience,
crossly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You find something and read it to me. I like to
hear your voice, even if I can’t keep my mind on it.
Wait a while though. I guess I’ll go and see how the
stable is getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down to kiss his wife, but she was once
more absorbed, and did not see him. He snatched the
book from her with an oath and flung it across the
room. She sprang to her feet with flashing eyes,
pushed him aside with no gentle hand, and ran after
the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sha’n’t read that book!” he cried. “The idea
of forgetting your husband for a book—<span class='it'>a book</span>! You
are a lovely wife! You are a disgrace to the name!
You would rather read than kiss your husband! I’ll
lock this room up, damned if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go and live with Miss Beale and do Temperance
work,” sobbed Patience. “I won’t live with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you won’t—what? What did I marry you
for? My God! What did I marry you for? My life
is hell, for I’m no fool. I know you don’t love me.
You married me for my money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had,” she exclaimed passionately, then
controlled herself. “I hope we are not going to
squabble in the usual commonplace way. I shall not,
at any rate. If you lose your temper, you can have the
quarrel all to yourself. I shall not pay any attention
to you. Now go out to the stable and cool off, and
when you come back I’ll read something else to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Beverly disappeared, slamming the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if any one on earth has such a temper,”
she thought. “And people believe that vulgarity and
lack of control are confined to the lower classes! What
is the matter with civilisation anyhow? I can only
explain my own remarkable aberration in this way:
youthful love is a compound of curiosity, a surplus of
vitality, and inherited sentimentalism. It is likely to
arrive just after the gamut of children’s diseases has run
its course. Of course the disease is merely a complacent
state of the system until the germ arrives, which
same is the first attractive and masterful man. All
diseases run their course, however. I could not be
more insensible to Beverly Peele’s dead ancestors out
in the vault than I am to him. No woman is capable
of loving at nineteen. She is nothing but an overgrown
child, a chaos of emotions and imagination. There
ought to be a law passed that no woman could marry
until she was twenty-eight. Then, perhaps a few of us
would feel less like—Well, there is nothing to do but
make the best of it, regard life as a highly seasoned
comedy, in which one is little more than a spectator,
after all—and at present I have Heine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly did not return for an hour. When he did
she rose at once, and running her eye along the shelves,
selected a volume of Webster’s Speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like politics,” she said; “and all of us should
read the great works of our great men. I’ll read the
famous Seventh of March Speech.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she did, Beverly listening with considerable
attention. When she had finished he remarked enthusiastically,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what that speech has made me make
up my mind to do? I’m going to run for the Senate,
and make speeches like that myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience merely stared at him. She wondered if he
were really something more than a fool; if there was a
sort of post-graduate course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you look at me like that? Don’t you
think I can?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—” She hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! Is that the way you encourage a fellow?
You are a nice wife. Here my father has been at me
all my life to do something, and just as soon as I make
up my mind, my wife laughs at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t laugh at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s all the same. If I never do anything, it’ll
be your fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to the Senate just as fast as ever you can get
there. And you might as well spend the rest of the
day studying Webster; but suppose you read to yourself
for a while: my throat is tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to read to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, I hear Lawson coming. Luncheon
is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table in the dining-room had been divested of
its leaves, and the young couple sat only a few feet
apart. The room had once been a banqueting-hall.
It was very large and dark. The white light filtered
meagrely through the small panes. The wind moaned
through the naked elms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country is awfully dull in winter,” remarked
Patience. “I wish we were in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a beautiful speech to make to a husband.
I don’t mind so long as you are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am deeply flattered,” and she smiled
upon him. There seemed nothing else to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it!” cried Beverly, “this steak is as thin
as a plate and burnt to a cinder. Patience, I do wish
you’d give some of your attention to housekeeping and
less to books. It is your place to see that things are
properly cooked, now that Honora is gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear. I don’t know anything about cooking, or
housekeeping, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’d be much obliged if you’d learn as
quickly as possible. Take this steak out,” he said to
the maid, “and bring some cold beef or ham. Damn
it! I might have known that when Honora went away
I’d have nothing fit to eat, with this new cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience refused to continue the conversation, and
when the ham and beef came he ate of them with such
relish that his good-nature returned as speedily as it
had departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the afternoon the scene of the morning was
repeated with variations, and the same might be said of
the two following days. Then came an interval of
sleighing and skating. Then rain turned the snow to
slush, and once again Beverly exhibited the characteristics
of a caged tiger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have nervous prostration before the winter
is over,” thought Patience, who was still determined to
take the situation humorously, still refused to face her
former self. “I do wish the family would come back,
mother-in-law and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally, despite Beverly’s indignant protests, she
went to town for the day, and shopped or paid calls
with Hal. On one occasion they went to see Rosita.
That “beautiful young prima donna of ever increasing
popularity” wore black gauze over gold-coloured tights,
and acted and sang and danced and allured with
consummate art. The opera house was two-thirds
crowded with men, although there was the usual matinée
contingent of girls and young married women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” thought Patience, “she’s way ahead of
me, for she’s made a success of herself, at least, and is
not bothered with scruples and regrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter dragged along as slowly as if time had
lamed the old man, then fallen asleep. The relations
between Patience and Beverly became very strained.
His frequent tempers were alternated by sulks. He
was genuinely unhappy, for limited as he was, mentally
and spiritually, he was very human; and in his primitive
way he loved his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience’s resolution to go through life as a cynical
humourist, deaf and blind to the great wants of her
nature, died hard, but it died at last. Monotony
accentuated fact, and the time came when pretence
failed her, and she visibly shrank from his lightest
caress. The tide of horror and loathing had risen
slowly, but definitely. He threatened to kill her, to
commit suicide, to get a divorce; but his threats did
not disturb her. He was too weak to kill himself, too
proud to make himself ridiculous in the divorce courts,
and too much in love to put her beyond his reach.
What sustained her was the hope that his passion would
die a natural death, and that they would then go their
diverse ways as other married people did,—that had
come to seem to her the most blessed meaning of the
holy state of matrimony. Then she could enjoy her
books, and he would permit her to spend the winters
in New York, or in travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly’s affections, however, showed no sign of dissolution.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon in March, Patience, glancing out of the
library window, saw Hal coming up the lawn from the
path that led down the slope to the station. She suppressed
a war-whoop with which she and Rosita had
been used to awake the echoes of the Californian hills,
opened the window, and vaulted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” cried Miss Peele, as Patience ran toward her,
“you do look glad to see me, sure enough. Bev can’t
be very exciting, for you don’t look as if it were me
particularly—just somebody. Oh, matrimony! matrimony!
I envy the women that have solved the problem
in some other way—the journalists and artists, and
authors and actresses, and even the suffragists, God rest
them. Hello, there’s Bev. He looks as if he were
about to cry. What have you been doing to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left him writing an order for some new kind of
horse-feed,” said Patience, indifferently. Her husband
stood at the window, staring gloomily at the beaming
faces. When the girls entered the room he had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks as if he had just been let out of the dark
room. Do you beat him? What do you suppose my
mother will say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I suppose he’s bored too. You see it’s nearly
three months now. I tried to make him read, but after
the third day he went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal drew a low chair to the fire, close to the one
Patience occupied. She laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy your trying to make Bev intellectual! That
would be a good subject for a one-act farce. Well,
I’ve come up here to tell you something, and to talk it
over. I, too, am contemplating matrimony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t!” cried Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that is usually the advice of married
people, but the world goes on marrying itself just the
same. But my problem is much more complicated
than the average, for there are two men in the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two? You don’t mean to say you don’t know
your own mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is exactly the fact in the case. You remember
Reginald Wynne? Well, Patience, I do like that
man. I never liked any man one tenth as much. I
might say he’s the only serious man I’ve ever met, the
only one, to put it in another way, that I ever could
take seriously as a man. He has brains—he’s a
lawyer, you know, and they say very fine things of him—and
he is so kind, and <span class='it'>strong</span>. When I am with
him I don’t feel frivolous and worldly and one of a
dozen. If I have any better nature and any apology
for a brain, they are on top then. He is the last sort
of man I ever thought I’d fall in love with, but it takes
us some years to become acquainted with ourselves,
doesn’t it? I do respect him so, and it is such a novel
sensation. He even makes me read. Fancy! And
I’ve even promised him that I won’t read any more
French novels, excepting those he selects, nor smoke
cigarettes. So, you see, I am in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patience,” she continued with tragic emphasis,
“he hasn’t a red—and I know I’d be miserable,
poor. When papa saw which way the wind was blowing,
he took me into the library and told me that although he
made fifty thousand dollars a year, we spent nearly all
of it, and that he should not have much to leave besides
his life insurance—one hundred thousand—which of
course would go to mamma. It is a matter of honour
never to sell this place, and the revenue from the farm—which
is to go to Beverly—would keep it up in a
small way. The town house is to be May’s and mine;
but what will that amount to? May and I have always
pretty well understood that if we want to keep on having
the things that habit has made a necessity to us,
we must marry rich men! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the other man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has appeared on the scene lately. He is not
the usual alternative by any means, for he is very attractive
in his way. He has the manners of the man of
the world, a <span class='it'>fin de siècle</span> brain, and the devil in his eye.
He is rather good-looking and tremendously good form.
And, my dear, he has three cold millions. Think what
I should be with three millions! Fancy me in Boston on
three or four hundred dollars a month. Oh, Patience,
what shall I do?” And Hal, the most undemonstrative
of women, laid her head on Patience’s knee and
sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to come to see you, Patience,” she continued
after a moment. “I have no one else; I could never
have said a word of this to mamma or May. And I
like you better than any one in the world except Reginald
Wynne. And you seem to understand things.
Do tell me what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do this: Be true to your ideals. If love means,
and has always meant more to you than anything else
in the world, marry Reginald Wynne. If money and
power and luxury are the very essentials of happiness
to you, marry the other man. No temporary aberration
can permanently divert one’s paramount want
from its natural course. As soon as the novelty has
gone, the ego swings back to its old point of view as
surely as water does that has been temporarily dammed.
There is only one thing that persists, and that is the
ideal,—that habit of mind which is bred of heredity
and environment, even where care or consciousness is
lacking. It is as relentless and pitiless as the law of
cause and effect. I believe it would outlive a very
leprosy of the soul. And it makes no difference whether
that ideal be great or small, high or low, its hold is
precisely the same, for it is individuality itself. Rosita
is happy because she has realised her ideal. Miss
Tremont was happy because she lived up to hers. Miss
Beale was supremely satisfied with herself when she let
a man die whom she might have saved by smirching
her ideals. The religionists are happy generally, not
through communion with the presiding deity, as they
imagine, but because they have arbitrarily created a
sort of spiritual Blackstone whom they delight to obey.
The author is happy when he toils, even without hope
of reward. Martyrs have known ecstasy—But one
could go on for a week. Don’t marry Wynne if you
feel that you would be unhappy in poverty after the
first few months; and if you feel that great wealth
without love would be misery, don’t marry the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I could like Latimer Burr well enough,” said
Hal, staring gloomily at the fire; “and after a time I
suppose I’d forget. You see, I have been in love so
short a time that the wrench would be a good deal less
violent than the wrench from luxury—I’d soon get
over it, I expect. But I do like him—I never thought
I could feel like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience fondled the sleek head, but she was not in
a mood to feel in sympathy with love. The only thing
that to her seemed of paramount importance was to fix
a clear eye on the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she said, “the present is ever with us,
and the past recedes farther and farther. If the rich
man can give you what you most want, time will make
you forget the very sensation of love. If you marry
Wynne and the love goes, you will have equal difficulty
to recall it, and nothing to compensate in the
present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid that it would go; but I know that I
should be thoroughly miserable poor, and make him
miserable too. I do love it all so—all that money
means—why, one can’t even be well groomed without
money. It has gone to make up nine-tenths of my
composition; the other tenth is only a bit of miserable
wax. But I love this new feeling, and I never
believed that anything could be so sweet. Oh, dear;
I’ll have to dry up. Here comes Bev.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember this,” said Patience, “and let it console
you: however you feel or are torn, you’ll do one
thing only,—follow along the line of least resistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly entered and kissed his sister affectionately.
Her back was to the light, and he did not notice her
swollen eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are looking hilarious,” she remarked in
her usual flippant tones. “Has Tammany gone lame,
or Mrs. Langtry refused to take her five bars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wife doesn’t love me!” Beverly had brooded
upon his wrongs for two months. Hal’s words were as
a match to a mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed Patience, springing to her feet,
“don’t let us have a scene for Hal’s benefit. Do cultivate
a little good taste, if good sense is too far beyond
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words were not soothing, and Beverly exploded
in one of his most violent passions. He tore up and
down the room, banging his fist alternately on the
table, the mantel, and the books, and once he hit
the panel of a door so heavy a blow that it sprang.
Patience sat down and turned her back. Hal endeavoured
to stop him; but he had found a listener, and
would discharge his mind of its accumulated virus.
He told the tale of the winter in spasmodic gusts, hung
and fringed with oaths. Finally he flung himself out
of the room, shouting all the way across the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was an intense and meaning
silence between the two women; then Hal stood up
and laid her palms to her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience!” she said, “Patience! this is awful.
What have I done? Oh, does it really mean anything?
I have seen Bev go into tempers all my life—but—Tell
me, please—does this really mean anything—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether it does or does not it need not worry you
beyond warning you against mistakes on your own
account. I married with my eyes open, and I can take
care of myself. Don’t marry your rich man unless you
like him well enough to pretend to like him a good
deal more. If you do, you’ll end by loathing him and
yourself—and what is more, he’ll know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I don’t think I am as intense as you are—but
what do you suppose makes Beverly such a wild
animal? We are none of us like that, and never have
been, as far as I know, although some of the old boys
were pretty gay, not to say lawless. But for two or
three generations we seem to have been a fairly well-conducted
lot. Beverly is almost a freak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience crossed the room, and lifting down a volume
of Darwin’s “Descent of Man” read from the chapter
on Civilised Nations:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“‘With mankind some of the worst dispositions which
occasionally, without any assignable cause, make their
appearance in families, may perhaps be reversions to a
savage state from which we are not removed by very many
generations.’”</p>

</div>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Two weeks later Patience received a letter from Hal
which induced no surprise.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>The die is cast [it read]. Reginald Wynne has gone
back to Boston, and I am going to marry Latimer Burr.
On the first of April we sail for Europe—mamma and
May and I—to get our things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don’t imagine that I am doing the novel-heroine act,
and sprinkling my pillow o’ nights. I did feel terribly, and
I’ll never love any other man; but the thing is done, and
done for the best, and that is the end of it. What you said
about following along the line of least resistance is as sure
as love and fate and a good many other things; for what
Latimer Burr can give me I want more than what Reginald
Wynne can give me, and it drew me like a magnet.
And the other thing you said is equally true,—that the
only joy in life is to pursue your ideals to the bitter end.
Mine are not lofty, but they are <span class='it'>me</span>, and that is all there is
to it. I shall not weep it out, because I’ve no beauty to
lose, and weeping does no earthly good, anyway. If it
would give Wynne Burr’s fortune I’d drown New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We’ll be back on the first of June. We’re only going
over to order things. I wish you joy of Honora. It’s
too bad Bev is so much in love with you, or you might
switch him off on to her. Oh, Patience, dear, you don’t
know how much I’ve thought about you. It hurts me
<span class='it'>hard</span> to think that you are unhappy. I feel as guilty as a
murderer, but really I thought you’d get along. So many
women had been in love with Bev, I thought you would be,
too. I don’t think it had ever occurred to me that women
sometimes had a soul. If I had known as much then as I
do now I’d have done all I could to keep you apart, for
Beverly Peele certainly has not the attenuated ghost of a
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience, dear, do stand it out. Don’t, <span class='it'>don’t</span> get
a divorce. Remember that all over the world women are
as miserable as you are, and as I might be if I would
let myself go. Now, at least, you have compensations;
and when I am married I’ll do everything I can to make
life gay and pleasant for you; but don’t make a horrid
vulgar newspaper scandal and leave yourself without resources.
This world is a pretty good place after all when
you are on top, but it must be hell underneath.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Lovingly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Hal</span>.</p>

</div>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The day Mrs. Peele and her daughters sailed for
France Mr. Peele and his niece returned to the Manor.
Honora kissed Patience on either cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am so glad to come back to my lovely room,
and to see you, Patience dear,” she said wearily. “We
have had such a gay winter, and I am so tired. Dear
me, how fresh and sweet you look in that white frock.
I just long to get into thin things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Peele came up in the evening he narrowed
his lids as he kissed Patience, and regarded her critically.
“Well, how does Beverly wear in a three months’
<span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>?” he asked. “Gad! I shouldn’t care to
try it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she said flushing, “we didn’t talk much.
He had the farm and the horses to attend to, you
know, and I had the library. Oh, I am so glad you
have that library.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed aloud, with the harsh notes of a voice
unused to such music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you have had a Paul and Virginia time, as
Hal would say. I’m sorry you’ve put your foot in it,
for even you can’t make anything of him; but make
the best of it. Don’t leave him—Hal has told me
something, you see. It was best that she should.
There must be no scandal. If he makes too great a
nuisance of himself come to me; and if he cuts off
your allowance at any time just let me know, and I’ll
see that you have all the money you want. He doesn’t
own the farm. I like you. You’re a clever woman. If
you’d been my daughter I’d have been proud of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whether he really found pleasure in his daughter-in-law’s
society, or whether he merely thought it
politic to lighten her burden, from that time until the
return of the family he devoted his evenings to her.
He was deeply read, and Patience, after years of mental
loneliness, was grateful for his companionship, although
personally he antagonised her. He was a
mentality without heart or soul, and she knew that he
would sacrifice her as readily as he accepted her if it
better suited his purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clung to Honora during the day and read aloud
to her in the Tea House, while that devoted young
Catholic embroidered for the village church or sewed
for the poor of her beloved priest. Father O’Donovan,
a young man with a healthy serious face and a clear
eye, frequently joined them. Every morning the girls
rode or sailed. Beverly frequently made one of the
party, and Patience and Honora exercised all their
tact to keep him in good humour. In the evening he
played duets with his cousin. Her touch was as light
and hollow as an avalanche of icicles from the roof,
he pounded the piano as if it were a prize fighter’s
chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening Patience did not go downstairs until a
few moments before dinner was announced. As she
entered the library she saw that a stranger stood at the
window with Mr. Peele. The priest was present, and
she shook hands with him before going over to greet
the stranger and her father-in-law. While she was
agreeing with him that Honora in her white robe and
blue sash looked exactly like an angel, the man at the
window turned, and she recognised Mr. Field. She
ran forward and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” she cried. “I’m so glad to see you
again. I’ve wanted and wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand, smiling, but regarded her with
the keen gaze she so well remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul,” he said, “but you have changed.
It is not too much to say that you have improved.
Even the freckles have gone, I see. I thought I was
to make a newspaper woman of you. I felt rather cross
when you married. But this life certainly agrees with
you. You look quite the <span class='it'>grande dame</span>—quite—ah!
Good evening, sir,” as Beverly entered and was presented.
Mr. Field darted a glance from one to the
other, his mouth twitching sardonically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat at Patience’s right during dinner, and they
talked constantly. Beverly was sulky, and said nothing.
Mr. Peele rarely talked at table, even to Patience.
Honora and the priest conversed in a solemn undertone.
It is doubtful if two courses had been served
before the terrible old man understood the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s tragedy brewing here,” he thought, grimly.
“That fellow has the temper of a fiend in the skull of
a fool, and this girl is not the compound I take her to
be if she lives a lie very long for the sake of champagne
and truffles. I’d give a good deal to foresee the outcome.
Unless I’m all wrong there’ll be a two column
story on the first page of the ‘Day’ some fine morning.
Well, she’ll have its support, right or wrong.
She’s a brick, and he’s the sort of fellow a man always
wants to kick.—What is that?” he asked of the
priest, who had begun a story that suddenly appealed
to Mr. Field’s editorial instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A physician over at Mount Vernon, who stands
very high in his profession, has been accused of poisoning
his wife. She died in great agony, and her mother
insisted upon a post-mortem. Her stomach was full of
strychnine. He maintains that she threatened to commit
suicide repeatedly, and that he is innocent; but
opinion is against him, and people seem to think that
the jury will convict him. I knew both, and I feel
positive of his innocence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly he is innocent,” said Mr. Field.
“No physician of ordinary cleverness would bungle
like that. Strychnine! absurd! Why, there are poisons
known to all physicians and chemists which absolutely
defy analysis. I don’t doubt that more than one
doctor has put his wife out of the way, and the world
none the wiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that true?” said Patience, eagerly, leaning forward.
Her curious mind leapt at any new fact. “What
are they like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can’t say. That is a little secret known to
the fraternity only, although I don’t doubt they give
their friends the benefit of their knowledge occasionally.
Indubitably a large proportion of murderers are never
discovered—unless they discover themselves, like the
guilty pair in ‘Thérèse Raquin.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they belonged to the cruder order of civilisation,”
said Patience, lightly. “I am sure that if
I committed a murder, I should not be bothered by
conscience if I had felt myself justified in committing
it. It seems to me that if the development of the
intellect means anything it means the casting out of
inherited prejudices. Of course I don’t believe in
murder,” she continued, carried away as ever by the
pleasure of abstract reasoning, “but if a man of the
world and of brains, after due deliberation, makes way
with a person who is fatal to his happiness or his
career, then I think he must have sufficient development
of mental muscle to scorn remorse. The highest
intelligences are anarchistic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly there are those that have reached
that point of civilisation,” said Mr. Field, “but for my
part, I have not. Although I keep abreast of this
extraordinary generation, my roots are planted pretty
far down in the old one. But assuredly if I did feel
the disposition to murder, and succumbed, I’d cover
up my tracks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do these poisons give pain? Are they mineral or
vegetable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Field was about to answer, a peculiar expression
crossed his face, and Patience, following his eyes,
looked at Beverly. Her husband was staring at her
with his heavy brows together, the corners of his mouth
drawn down in an ugly sneer. To her horror and disgust
she felt the blood fly to her hair. At the same
time she became conscious that Mr. Peele, the priest,
and Honora were exchanging glances of surprise.
Beverly gave an abrupt unpleasant laugh, and pushing
his chair violently back, left the room. Patience
glanced appealingly about, then dropped her glance
to her plate. She felt as if the floor were dissolving
beneath her feet.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A week later, after a pleasant morning in the Tea
House with Honora and Father O’Donovan, she left
it to go to the library. As she turned the corner of the
house she saw Beverly standing close to one of the
windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing there?” she asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brows were lowered and his skin looked black, as
it always did when his angry passions were risen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been watching you and that priest,” he said
savagely, following her as she retreated hastily out of
earshot of the people in the Tea House. “I saw you
exchanging glances with him! Now I know why you
want to know so much about poisons—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you insane?” she cried. “What on earth are
you talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not insane—by God! You’re in love with
that priest, and I know it. But I’m on the watch—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—you—you—” stammered Patience. She
could not speak. Her face was crimson with anger and
disgust. In her husband’s eyes she was an image of
guilt. He burst into a sneering laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think I’m a fool, I suppose, because I don’t
know anything about books. But a woman said once
that I had the instincts of the devil, and I’ve no idea
of—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience found her tongue. “You poor fool,” she
said. “It was ridiculous of me to pay any attention
whatever to you; but I am not used to being insulted,
even by you. And remember that I am not used to any
display of imagination in you. As for <span class='it'>love</span>—” the scorn
with which she uttered the word made even him wince—“do
not worry. You have made me loathe the thing.
I could not fall in love with a god. Don’t have the
least fear that I shall be unfaithful to you. I couldn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked away, leaving Beverly trembling and
speechless. When she reached her room she locked
the doors and sobbed wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?” she
thought. “I can’t stand it any longer. I believe I
really would kill him if I stayed. I feel as if my nature
were in ruins. I hate myself! I loathe myself! I’ll
leave this very day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had said the same thing many times. Why
does a woman hesitate long before she leaves the man
who has made life shocking to her? Indolence, abhorrence
of scandal, shame to confess that she has
made a failure of her life, above all, lack of private
fortune and the uncertainty of self-support. For whatever
the so-called advanced woman may preach, woman
has in her the instinct of dependence on man, transmitted
through the ages, and a sexual horror of the
arena. Patience let the days slip by, hoping, as women
will, that the problem would solve itself, that Beverly
Peele would die, or become indifferent, or that she
would drift naturally into some other sphere.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Peele and the girls returned with the June roses;
the house was filled with guests at once. The Cuban
had gone to his islands for the summer, and May
chose to wear the willow and occasionally to weep upon
Patience’s unsympathetic shoulder; but as frequently
she consoled herself with the transient flirtation. Hal,
apparently, was her old gay self. She did not mention
Wynne’s name, and Patience was equally reticent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be the last to remind any woman of what
she wished to forget,” she thought. “And love—what
does it amount to anyhow? If He came I believe I
should hate him, because once I felt something like
passion for him too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had looked forward with some curiosity to meeting
Latimer Burr. He also had been in Paris. He
followed his lady home on the next steamer, and immediately
upon his return came to Peele Manor.
Patience did not meet him until dinner. She sat beside
him, and at once became acutely aware that he was a
man of superlative physical magnetism. She proscribed
him accordingly—magnetism was a repellent force at
this stage of her development. She was rather surprised
that she could feel it again, so completely had Beverly’s
evaporated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burr was a tall heavily built man about forty years
old. He carried himself and wore his clothes as only
a New York man can. His face was florid and well
modelled, his mouth and half closed eyes sensual. But
his voice and manners were charming. He appeared
to be deeply in love with Hal, and his voice became a
caress when he spoke to her. Patience did not like
his type, but she forgave him individually because he
was fond of Hal and appeared to possess brains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell into conversation with him, and his manner
would have led her to believe that while she spoke
neither Hal nor any other woman existed. To this
Patience gave little attention: she had met that manner
before; it was pleasant, and she missed it when lacking;
but she had practised it too often herself to feel
more than its passing fascination. His eyes, however,
were more insistently eloquent than his manner,
and their eloquence was of the order that induced
discomposure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience at times looked very lovely, and she was at
her best to-night. Her white skin was almost transparent,
and the wine had touched her cheeks with
pink. The sadness of her spirit had softened her eyes.
Her gown of peacock blue gauze fitted her round elastic
figure very firmly, and her bare throat and neck and
arms were statuesque. She had by no means the young
married woman look, but she had some time since acquired
an “air,” much to Hal’s satisfaction. To all
appearances she was a girl, but her figure was womanly.
Although about five feet six, and built on a more generous
plan than the average New York woman, she walked
with all their spring and lightness of foot. Her round
waist looked smaller than it was; she never laced.
Lately she had discovered that she “had an arm,” as
Hal would have phrased it, and the discovery had given
her such satisfaction that she had forgotten her troubles
for the hour, and sent for a dressmaker to take the
sleeves out of her evening gowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burr also discovered it, and murmured his approval
as caressingly as were he addressing his prospective
bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The milk-white woman!” he ejaculated softly.
“The milk-white woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you get any farther?” asked Patience. “If
you were a poet now, that would make a good first
line for a rhapsody—to Hal, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed indulgently. “How awfully bright you
are. I am afraid of you.” But he did not look in the
least afraid. “You are to be my sister, you know.
We must become friends at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And flattery is the quickest and surest way of establishing
the fraternal relation? Well, you are quite
right; but just look at my hair for a change, will you?”
(She felt as if her skin must be covered with red spots.)
“Or my profile. They are also good points.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are exquisite. I have rarely seen a woman so
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear! Dear! How relieved you must be to feel
that you can keep your hand in without straying too far
from Peele Manor. And there is also Honora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t admire Miss Mairs. She is too tall, and her
nose is too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor dear Honora! But how well you understand
women! What tact! I like you so much better than
I did before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed again in his indulgent way. “You
mustn’t guy me. It is your fault if I pay you too many
compliments. You are a very fascinating woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wonderfully entertaining. What must you
be when you are in love! What do you and Hal talk
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Hal a dear little girl? I do love her. I
never loved a woman so much in my life—never proposed
before. She is so bright. She keeps me amused
all the time. I always said I’d never marry a woman
that didn’t amuse me, and I’ve kept my word. It
isn’t so much what she says, don’t you know, as the
way she says it. Dear little girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this subject they could agree, and Patience kept
him to it as long as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner Burr went with Mr. Peele into the
library. Patience, passing through the room, found
them talking earnestly upon the great question of the
day,—the financial future of the country. She paused
a moment, then sat down. To her surprise she found
that Burr was master of his subject, and possessed of a
gift of words which fell little short of eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument lasted an hour, during which Patience
sat with her elbows on the table, her chin on her folded
hands, her eager eyes glancing from one to the other.
Occasionally she smiled responsively as Burr made
some felicitous phrase. When the discussion was over,
Mr. Peele left the room. Burr arose at once and
seated himself beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never talked so well,” he said. “You inspired
me;” and he took her hand in the matter-of-fact manner
she knew so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talked quite as well before you saw me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you were there—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kindly let me have my hand. I have only two—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Let me hold your hand. I want to!
I am going to—Why are you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you Hal’s hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God! You don’t expect me to go through
life holding one woman’s hand? Hal is the most fascinating
woman in the world, and I love her—but I
want you to let me love you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite immaterial to me whether you love me
or not; and, I think, if you want plain English, that
you are a scoundrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, come. You—<span class='it'>you</span>—must know more
of the world than to talk like that. Why am I a scoundrel?”
He looked much amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are engaged to one woman and are making
love to another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of that so long as she doesn’t know it?
I shall be the most uxorious and indulgent of husbands—but
faithful—that is not to be expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have great confidence in me. Suppose I
describe this scene and conversation to Hal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not,—not out of regard for me, but because
you love Hal—dear little girl! And you are one of
the few women devoid of the cat instincts. That long-legged
girl, now, has a whole tiger inside of her, but
you have only the faults of the big woman. I hope
you have their weaknesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you shall never know if I have. Please let go
my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung it from him. “Oh, well,” he said, haughtily,
“I hoped we should be friends, but if you will have it
otherwise, so be it;” and he stalked out, and devoted
himself to Hal for the rest of the evening.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny world,” thought Patience. She shrugged her
beautiful young shoulders cynically, and went forth to
do her duty by the guests. As she passed out of the
front door to join some one of the scattered groups on
the lawns, she heard a voice which made her pause and
tap her forehead with her finger. It was a rich deep
voice, with a vibration in it, and a light suggestion of
brogue. She turned to the drawing-room, whence it
came. A man in riding clothes was talking to Mrs.
Peele, who was listening with a bend of the head that
meant much to Patience’s trained eye. The man had
an athletic nervous figure, suggestive of great virility
and suppressed force, although it was carried with a fine
repose. The thick black hair on his large finely shaped
head glinted here and there with silver. His profile
was aquiline, delicately cut and very strong, his mouth,
under the slight moustache, neither full nor thin, and
both mobile and firm, the lips beautifully cut. The
eyes, deeply set, were not large, and were of an indefinite
blue grey, but piercing, restless, kind, and humourous.
There were lines about them, and a deep line on one
side of his mouth. His lean face had a touch of red
on its olive. He might have been anywhere between
thirty-five and forty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience recognised him and trembled a little, but
with excitement, not passion. She had understood herself
for once when she had said that in her present
conditions she was incapable of love. Beverly Peele
would have to go down among the memories before his
wife could shake her spirit free, and turn with swept
brain and clear eyes to even a conception of the love
whose possibilities dwelt within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was fully alive to the picturesqueness of
meeting this man once more, and suddenly became
possessed of the spirit of adventure. There must be
some sort of sequel to that old romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She withdrew to the shadow of a tree, where she
could watch the drawing-room through the window.
Burr entered, slapped the visitor on the back, and bore
him away to the dining-room, presumably to have a
drink. When they returned, Mr. Peele was in the room.
He shook hands with the stranger more heartily than
was his wont. In a few moments he crossed over to the
library, and Patience, seeing that her early hero would
be held in conversation for some time to come, followed
her father-in-law and asked casually who the visitor was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s Bourke, Garan Bourke, the legal idol,”
sarcastically, “of Westchester County. In truth he’s a
brilliant lawyer enough, and one of the rising men at
the New York bar, although he will go off his head
occasionally and take criminal cases. I don’t forgive
him that, if he <span class='it'>is</span> always successful. However, we all
have our little fads. I suppose he can’t resist showing
his power over a jury. I heard an enthusiastic youngster
assert the other day that Bourke whips up a jury’s
grey matter into one large palpitating batter, then
moulds it with the tips of his fingers while the jury sits
with mouth open and spinal marrow paralysed. Personally,
I like him well enough, and rather hoped he
and Hal would fancy each other. But he doesn’t seem
to be a marrying man. You’d better go over and meet
him. He’ll just suit you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience returned to her post. Burr had disappeared,
Bourke was talking to half a dozen women. In a few
moments he rose to go. Patience went hastily across
the lawns to the narrow avenue of elms by the driveway.
No two were billing and cooing in its shadows, and
Beverly was in bed with a nervous headache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was large and very brilliant. One could
have read a newspaper as facilely as by the light of an
electric pear. As Bourke rode to the main avenue a
woman came toward him. He had time to think her
very beautiful and of exceeding grace before she surprised
him by laying her hand on his horse’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she said, looking up and smiling as he
reined in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he stammered, lifting his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am too heavy to ride before you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her perplexedly, but made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still if I were up a tree—literally, you know—and
a band of terrible demons were shouting at a man
beside a corpse—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” he said. “Not you?—not you? That
homely fascinating little girl—no, it cannot be possible—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” lifting her chin, coquettishly. “I have
improved, and grown, you see. I was more than delighted
when I saw you through the window. It was
rather absurd, but I disliked the idea of going in to
meet you conventionally—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his hand strongly on hers, and she treated
him with a passivity denied to Latimer Burr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to tie up my horse and talk to you a
while, may I?” America and the law had not crowded
all the romance out of his Irish brain, and he was keenly
alive to the adventure. He had forgotten her name
long since, and it did not occur to him that this lovely
impulsive girl was the property of another man; but
although he had lived too long, nor yet long enough,
to lose his heart to the first flash of magnetism from
a pretty woman, yet his blood was thrilled by the commingling
of spirituality and deviltry in the face of this
high-bred girl who cared to give the flavour of romance
to their acquaintance. He saw that she was clever, and
he had no intention of making a fool of himself; but
he was quite willing to follow whither she cared to lead.
And it was night and the moon was high; the leaves
sang in a crystal sea; a creek murmured somewhere;
the frogs chanted their monotonous recitative to the
hushed melodies and discords of the night world; the
deep throbbing of steamboats came from the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tied his horse to a tree, and they entered the
avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me that it was a small world, and that
we should probably meet again,” she said; “and I never
doubted that we should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I never did either,” he exclaimed. He was
racking his brains to recall the conversation which had
passed between them a half dozen years ago, and for
the life of him could not remember a word; but he
was a man of resource.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad that it is at night,” he continued, “even
if the scene is not so charming as Carmel Valley from
that old tower. How beautiful the ocean looked from
there, and what a jolly ride we had in the pine
woods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She understood perfectly, and grinned in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I remember I gave you some advice,” he exclaimed
with suspicious abruptness. “I thought afterward
that it was great presumption on my part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you had an ideal of your own in mind
when you spoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ideal?” He cursed his memory and floundered
hopelessly. Even his Irish wit for once deserted
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hoped you had not forgotten it. Why, I
have made a little ‘Night Thoughts’ of what you said,
and it has been one of the strongest forces in my development.
Shall I repeat it to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please.” He was blushing with pleasure, but
sore perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she repeated his comments and advice, word
for word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible that you remember all that? I am
deeply flattered.” And he was, in fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more natural than that I should remember?
I was a lonely little waif, full of dreams and vague
ideals, and with much that was terrible in my actual
life. I had never talked with a young man before—a
man of seventy was my only experience of your sex,
barring boys, that don’t count. And you swooped
down into my life in the most picturesque manner
possible, and talked as no one in my little world was
capable of talking. So, you see, it is not so remarkable
that I retain a vivid impression of you and your words.
I was frightfully in love with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—were you? Were you?” He was very much
at sea. It was true that she had paid him the most
subtle tribute one mind can pay to another, but her
very audacity would go to prove that she was a brilliant
coquette. He had a keen sense of the ridiculous, and
he was still a little afraid of her. He took refuge on
the broad impersonal shore of flirtation, where the boat
is ever dancing on the waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you felt obliged to use the past tense you might
have left that last unsaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there are a thousand years between fifteen
and twenty-one. I am quite another person, as you
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are merely an extraordinary child developed;
and you have carried your memory along with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, the memory is there, and the tablets are
pretty full; but never mind me. I want to know if your
ideals are as strong now as I am sure they were then—if
any one in this world manages to hold onto his
ideals when circumstances don’t happen to coddle
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “I’m afraid I haven’t
thought much about them since that night. I doubt
if I’d given too much thought to them before. Deep
in every man’s brain is an ideal of some sort, I imagine,
but it is seldom he sits down and analyses it out. He
knows when he’s missed it and locked the gates behind
him, and perhaps, occasionally, he knows when
he’s found it—or something approximating it. We
are all the victims of that terrible thing called Imagination,
which, I sometimes think, is the sudden incursion
of a satirical Deity. I have not married—why, I can
hardly say. Perhaps because there has been some
vague idea that if I waited long enough I might meet
the one woman; but partly, also, because I have had
no very great desire to marry. I keep bachelor’s hall
over on the Sound, and the life is very jolly and free of
small domestic details. There are so many women
that give you almost everything you want—or at least
four or five will make up a very good whole—that I
have never yet faced the tremendous proposition of
going through life expecting one woman to give me
everything my nature and mind demand. But there
are such women, I imagine,” he added abruptly, trying
to see her face in one of the occasional splashes of
moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very clever woman—Mrs. Lafarge; perhaps you
know her—said to me the other day, that many men
and women of strong affinity took a good deal of spirituality
with them into marriage, but soon forgot all
about it—matrimony is so full of reiterant details, and
everything becomes so matter of course. Do you think
that is true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid it is. The imagination wears blunt.
The Deity is sending his electricity elsewhere—to
those still prowling about the shores of the unknown.
Perhaps if one could keep the danger in mind—if one
were unusually clever—I don’t know. I fancy civilisation
will get to that point after a while. Unquestionably
the companionship of man and woman, when no
essentials are lacking, is the one supremely satisfying
thing in life. If we loved each other, for instance—on
such a night—it seems to me that we are in tune—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t love each other, as it happens, and
we met about three quarters of an hour ago. We’ll
probably hate each other by daylight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope not,” he said, accepting the ice-water.
“But tell me what your ideals were. I hope they have
proved more stable than mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mine were a sort of yearning for some unseen
force in nature; I suppose the large general force from
which love is a projection. Every mortal, except the
purely material, the Beverly Peele type, for instance,
has an affinity with something in the invisible world,
an uplifting of the soul. Christianity satisfies the great
mass, hence its extraordinary hold. Do you suppose
the real link between the soul of man and the soul
of nature will ever be established?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed a little, piqued, but amused. “You are
very clever,” he said, “and this is just the hour and
these are just the circumstances for impersonal abstractions.
Well—perhaps the link will be established
when we have lived down this civilisation and entered
upon another which has had drilled out of it all the
elements which plant in human nature the instincts of
cupidity and sordidness and envy and political corruption,
and all that goes to make us the aliens from nature
that we are. About all that keeps us in touch with her
now are our large vices. There is some tremendous
spiritual force in the Universe which projects itself into
us, making man and nature correlative. What wonder
that man—particularly an imaginative and intelligent
child—should be affected and played upon by this
Mystery? What wonder that the heathens have gods,
and the civilised a symbol called the Lord God?—a
concrete something which they can worship, and upon
which unburden the load of spirituality which becomes
oppressive to matter? It is for the same reason that
women fall in love and marry earlier than men, who
have so many safety-valves. On the other hand, men
who have a great deal of emotional imagination and
who can neither love nor accept religion take refuge
in excess. It is all a matter of temperament. Cold-blooded
people—those that have received a meagre
share of this great vital force pervading the Universe,
which throws a continent into convulsions or a human
being into ecstasy—such, for instance, are religious
only because their ancestors were,—their brain is
pointed that way. Their blood has nothing to do
with it, as is the more general case—for Christianity
is pre-eminently sensuous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose will take its place? The world
is bound to become wholly civilised in time; but still
human nature will demand some sort of religion (which
is another word for ideality), some sort of lodestar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A superlative refinement, I think; a perfected
æstheticism which shall by no means eradicate the strong
primal impulses; which shall, in fact, create conditions
of higher happiness than now exist. Do we not enjoy
all arts the more as they approach perfection? Does
not a nude appeal with more subtle strength to the
senses the more exquisite its beauty, the more entire
its freedom from coarseness? When people strive to
place human nature on a level with what is highest in
art and in nature itself, the true religion will have been
discovered. So far, man himself is infinitely below
what man has achieved. It is hard to believe that
genius is the result of any possible combination of
heredity. It would seem that it must, like its other
part, imagination, be the direct and more permanent
indwelling of the supreme creative force—as if the
creator would lighten his burden occasionally, and
shakes off rings which float down to torment favoured
brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always knew that I should love to hear you talk,”
murmured Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand closed over hers. He drew it through his
arm and held it against his heart, which was beating
irregularly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I haven’t talked so much nor such stuff to
a woman since God made me. I believe that I could
talk to you through twenty years. You have said
enough to-night to make me hope that our minds
have been running along the same general lines.
Tell me—honestly—no coquetry—has what I said
that night had the slightest effect in your development?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told the tale of the day in the crystal woods,
giving a sufficiently comprehensive sketch of the events
which had led up to it to make her the more keenly
interesting to the man whose brain was beginning to
whirl a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had come at that moment,” she concluded,
“I would have gone with you to the end of the earth.
I have a pretty strong personality, but there was a good
deal of wax in me then, and if you could have gotten
it between your hands I think that what you moulded
would have closely resembled your ideal—the impression
you had already made had so strongly coloured
and trained my imagination. But,” she continued
hastily, and glancing anxiously to the far distant end of
the avenue, “you see my life changed immediately
after that, and I went into the world and became hard
and bitter and cynical. I have no ideals left, and I do
not want any—I have seen too much—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” he said passionately, “I do not believe a
word of it. Why, that was not two years ago, and you
are still a young girl. Have you loved any one else?”
he asked abruptly, his voice less steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too excited to note the meaning of her
emphasis. He was only conscious that he was very
close to a beautiful woman who allured him in all ways
as no one woman had ever done before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are full of a girl’s cynicism,” he said; “you
have seen just enough to make you think you know the
world—to accept the superficial for the real. You—you
yourself are an ideal. All you need is to know
yourself, and I am going to undertake the task of
teaching you—do you hear? If I fail—if I have
made a mistake—if it is only the night and your
beauty that have gone to my head—well and good;
but I shall have the satisfaction of having tried—of
knowing—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! No, no!” she said. “You must not come
here again. I do not want to see you again—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! You have some sentimental foolish
idea in your head,—or perhaps you are engaged to
some man who can give you great wealth and position.
I shall not regard that, either. If I feel to you by
daylight as I do now, I’ll have you—do you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience opened her lips to tell him the truth, then
cynically made up her mind to let matters take their
course. At the same time she was bitterly resentful
that she should feel as she did, not as she had once
dreamed of feeling for this man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she said, “I shall be here for a
while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall see you in the course of a day or two.
I’m going now. Good-night.” He let her arm slip
from under his, but held her hand closely. “And even
if it so happened that I never did see you again, I
should thank you for the glimpse you have given me of
a woman I hardly dared dream existed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had gone she anathematised fate for a
moment, then went back to her guests.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Latimer Burr was evidently a man upon whom rebuff
sat lightly. The next morning he came suddenly upon
Patience in a dark corner, and tried to kiss her. Whenever
the opportunity offered he held her hand, and
once, to her infinite disgust, he planted his foot squarely
on hers under the dinner table. A few hours later they
happened to be alone in one of the small reception-rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” exclaimed Patience, wrathfully, “will
you let me alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t,” he said good-naturedly. “Jove! but
you are a beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wore a gown of white mull and lace, trimmed
with large knots of dark-blue velvet. She had been
talking all the evening with Mr. Peele, Mr. Field, and
Burr, and was somewhat excited. Her lips were very
pink, her eyes very bright and dark. She held her
head with a young triumph in beauty and the intellectual
tribute of clever men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal would be delighted. She has always wanted
me to become the fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never will be that, for there are not enough
brainy men in society to appreciate you. If all
were like myself, you would be wearied with the din of
admiration—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing like having a good opinion of
oneself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I don’t set up to be an intellectual
man—intellectual men are out of date; but I’m a brainy
man, and I’d like to know how I’m to help being
aware of the fact. I certainly don’t claim to be pretty,
so you can’t say I’m actually wallowing in conceit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was forced to laugh. “Oh, you’d do very
well if you’d exercise as much sense in regard to women
as you do to affairs. Just answer me one question,
will you? Are you so amazingly fascinating that
women have the habit of succumbing at the end of the
second interview?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never set up to be an ass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your manner is quite assured. You seem very
much surprised that I don’t tumble into your arms
and say ‘Thank you.’ Oh, you New York men are
so funny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, answer me one question—you don’t love
your husband, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would if you wouldn’t make such an idiot of
yourself. You certainly are very agreeable to talk to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came closer, his lids falling. The fine repose of
his manner was a trifle ruffled. “Do you love anybody
else?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let me love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if you don’t love your husband and you like
me and will not let me love you, you must have a
lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience burst into brief hilarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the logic of your kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A beautiful woman that does not love her husband
always loves another man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or is willing to be loved by the first man that happens
to have no other affair on hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have said that you like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say I loved you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d make you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” with a deep contempt he was incapable of
understanding, “you couldn’t. But tell me another
thing; I’m very curious. Has it never occurred to
you that a woman must be wooed, that it is somewhat
necessary to arouse sentiment and feeling in her before
she is willing to advance one step? Why, you and your
kind demand her off-hand in a way that is positively
funny. What has become of all the old traditions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bother,” he said. “Life is too short to waste
time on old-fashioned nonsense. If a man wants a
woman he says so, and if she’s sensible and likes him
she meets him half way. Men and women of the
world know what they want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all there is to love then? It no longer
means anything else whatever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—you are all wrong. If you were not a spiritual
woman I wouldn’t cross the room to win you.
One can buy the other sort. It is your spirituality,
your intellectuality, that fascinates me as much as
your beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know about spirituality?” she said
contemptuously. “I don’t like to hear you speak the
word. You desecrate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed purple. “There are few things I don’t
understand—and a good deal better than you do,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a clever man’s perception, that is all.
Association with all sorts of women has taught you the
difference between them. But what could you give a
spiritual woman? Nothing. You have not a shrunken
kernel of soul. The sensual envelope is too thick;
your brain too crowded with the thousand and one petty
experiences of material life. You are as ingenuous as
all fast men, for the women you have spent your life
running after make no demands upon subtlety—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care,” he said angrily; “you are going too
far. I tell you I have as much soul as any man living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. I doubt if any man has much. Men
give women nothing, as far as I can see. If we want
companionship there seems nothing to do but to descend
to your level and grovel with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would never make you grovel. I would reverence—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rot!” she cried, stamping her foot. “What a
fool—and worse—the average woman must be.
You have no idea how ingenuously you are giving away
the women of society. And soul! The idea of a
man who pretends to love the woman he is engaged
to and is making love to another, and that her sister-in-law
and most intimate friend, claiming to have a soul!
Have you no sense of humour? I say nothing about
honour, as I wish to be understood, if possible; but
you are clever enough to see the ridiculous in most
things—Please don’t walk over me. There is plenty
of room. And the windows are open, you know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I am here,” cried a furious voice, and
Beverly sprang into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stepped back with a faint exclamation.
Burr turned white. Beverly was shaking with rage.
His face was almost black; there were white flecks on
his nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kept quiet,” he articulated, “to hear every word.
You dog!” to Burr. “I may be pretty bad, but I’d
never do what you have done. And as for you,” he
shook his fist at his wife, “you were only leading
him on. If I could only have held myself in another
moment I’d have seen you in his arms. Get out
of this house,” he roared, “both of you. You’ll
never marry my sister. I’m going to tell her this
minute—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burr sprang forward and caught him by the collar;
but Beverly was not a coward. He turned, flinging
out his fist, and the two men grappled. Patience
closed the door and glanced out of the window. No
one was near. Voices floated up from the cliffs. Burr
was the more powerful man of the two, and in a
moment had flung Beverly, panting, into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep him here,” said Patience, rapidly, and she
left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man is certainly still a savage, a brute,” she
thought. “What is the matter with civilisation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she crossed the lawn, she met one of the servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and find Miss Hal, and ask her to come here,”
she said. A few moments later her sister-in-law hurried
up from the cliffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she called cheerily. “Has Bev had
an apoplectic fit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beverly has been making a greater fool of himself
than usual,” said Patience, as the girls met, “and
I want to see you before he does. I was standing in
one of the reception-rooms talking to Mr. Burr after
Mr. Field and Mr. Peele had gone out, and he had on
all his manner and was telling me how beautiful I was,
in his usual after dinner style, when Beverly leaped
through the window like the wronged husband in the
melodrama and accused us of making love. He threatened
to come and tell you, and he and Mr. Burr
wrestled like two prize-fighters. If Beverly were put
on the witness stand he’d be obliged to admit that
Mr. Burr had not so much as touched my hand. I
suppose you will believe me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal gave her light laugh. “Certainly, my dear,
certainly; although if I were a man I should fall in
love with you myself. I wouldn’t bet on Latimer,
but I would on you—so don’t worry your little head.
Do you suppose I expect a man with that mouth and
those eyes to be faithful to me? Still, I must say that
I should have given him credit for more decency than
to make love to my sister-in-law—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t! I swear he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course not! Nor will he make love to
every pretty woman he finds himself alone with for five
minutes. He can’t help it, poor thing. Let us go and
talk to the gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they entered the little room she exclaimed airily,
“Been making a fool of yourself again, Bev? No,
don’t speak. Patience has told me all about it. I
have every confidence in her and Latimer. Better go
and take a spin with Tammany. Latimer, you really
must mend your manners. They’re too good. From
a distance a stranger would really think you were making
love when you are swearing at the heat. Now, come
down to the Tea House. Good-night, Bevvy dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she went off between her lover and her sister-in-law,
leaving her brother to swear forth his righteous
indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Patience opened the door of her husband’s
room for the first time. Beverly, who had just
entered, was so astonished that the wrath he had carefully
nourished fell like quicksilver under a cool wave,
and he stared at her without speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to tell you,” said his wife, “that you were
entirely justified in being angry to-night. I could have
suppressed Burr by a word, but I chose to lead him on
to gratify my curiosity. Hal wishes to marry him, and
I am determined that she shall. If I had admitted
the truth to her or permitted you to enlighten her, her
self-respect would have forced her to break the engagement.
That would have been absurd, for the match is
exactly what she wants, and she is not marrying with
illusions. But you have been treated inconsiderately,
and I apologise for my share in it. Will you forgive
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’ll forgive you,” said Beverly, eagerly.
“I wasn’t angry with you, anyhow—only with that
scoundrel. But I never believed you’d do this. Do
you care for me a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience averted her face that she might not see the
expression on his. Despite her loathing of him she
gave him a certain measure of pity. With all the preponderance
of the savage in him and the limitations of
his intelligence he had his own capacity for suffering,
and to-night he stood before her crushed under the
sudden reaction, his eyes full of the dumb appeal of
shrinking brutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we are going to live peacefully don’t let us
discuss that subject,” she said gently. “We have both
missed it, and I sometimes think that you are more
to be pitied than I am. However, I shall not flirt—I
promise you that. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the last of Mr. Burr’s illegal love-making at
Peele Manor. He had had a fright and a lesson, and
he forgot neither.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Garan Bourke is coming to dinner to-night,” said
Hal, the next day. “It’s the hardest thing in the
world to get him; he never goes anywhere; but he
half promised mamma, when he called the other night,
that he’d come some day this week, and he wrote
yesterday, saying he’d dine with us to-day. I want
you to meet him. He is awfully clever, and when he
talks I want to close my eyes and listen to his voice.
If the dear girls ever get the vote and do jury duty, all
he’ll have to do will be to quote law. He needn’t
take the trouble to sum up. His voice will do the
business every time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, in a French gown of black chiffon, was
very beautiful that night. She did not go down to
dinner until every one was seated. Bourke sat next to
Mrs. Peele. Her own chair was near the end of the
opposite side of the long table. For a time she did
not look at Bourke. When she did she met his eyes;
and knew by their expression that some one had told
him she was the wife of Beverly Peele.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner he went with Mr. Peele and Burr into
the library. Patience was about to follow a party of
young people down to the bluff, when Mr. Field drew
her arm firmly through his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going to desert your court?” he said.
“Why, you don’t suppose I come up here to talk to
Peele, do you? If you go out with those boys I’ll
never come here again.” And he led her into the
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly twelve o’clock when she found herself
alone with Bourke. The others had gone out, one by
one. She had made no attempt to follow them. She
sat with defiant eyes and inward trepidation. Bourke
regarded her with narrowed eyes and twitching nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are married?” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you deliberately made a fool of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—I did nothing deliberately that night—no—I
acted on impulse. And all that I said was
quite true. Of course I should have told you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it would have spoiled your comedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—don’t think that. I see that I was
dishonest—I am not making excuses—I never
thought you’d become really interested—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not breaking my heart. Don’t let that worry
you. The mere fact of your dishonesty is quite enough
to break the spell—for you are not the woman I imagined
you to be. I was merely worshipping an ideal
for the hour. Do you love your husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are a harlot,” he said, deliberately. “It
only needed that.” He rose to his feet and looked
contemptuously at her scarlet face. “At all events it
was an amusing episode,” he said. “Good-night.”</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was a matter of comment before the summer was
over, both among the guests at Peele Manor and the
neighbours, that Mr. and Mrs. Beverly Peele had come
to the parting of the ways. As the young man’s infatuation
was as notable as his wife’s indifference, he
received the larger share of sympathy. The married
men championed Patience and expressed it in their
time-honoured fashion; and although they worried her
she looked forward with terror to the winter: she
would willingly have taken them all to board and
trusted to their wives to keep them in order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly had confided his woes long since to his
mother. She declined to discuss the subject with her
daughter-in-law, but treated her with a chill severity.
Fortunately they were gay that summer, and Patience
had much to do. Hal and May were absorbed in
preparations for their wedding, and the duties of hostess
fell largely on her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the fall there was a double wedding under
the medallion of Peele the First. Immediately thereafter
May went to Cuba; and Hal to Europe, to pay a
series of visits. Mrs. Peele continued to entertain, and
was obliged to confess that her daughter-in-law was
very useful, and in deportment above reproach. Outwardly
Patience looked almost as cold a woman of the
world as herself, and gave no evidence of the storms
brewing within; but one day she hung out a signal.
Mrs. Peele announced that she should go to town on
the first of December. Patience followed her into her
bedroom and closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I speak to you a moment alone?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Peele, frigidly. “Will you
sit down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She herself took an upright chair, and suggested,
Patience thought, a judge on his bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to go to town with you this winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be happy to have my dear son with me,
and I will not deny that you are a great help to me;
but Beverly is as strongly opposed as ever to city life.
I asked him myself to go down for the winter, but he
refused. He is one of Nature’s own children, and loves
the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly is very close to Nature in several of
her moods. But I wish to go whether he does or
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would leave your husband?” Mrs. Peele
spoke with meditative scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be better for both of us not to be shut
up here together for another winter. I—I will not
answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a threat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can take it as you choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not love my son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are not ashamed to make such an
admission?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you prefer to have me lie about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is your duty to love your husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That proposition is rather too absurd for argument,
don’t you think so? Will you persuade Beverly to let
me go with you to town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not. You should be glad, overjoyed, to
have such a husband. You should feel grateful,” she
added, unburdening her spite in the vulgarity which
streaks high and low, “that he loved you well enough
to overlook your lack of family and fortune—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience had left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening she went to her father-in-law and
stated her case. She spoke calmly, although she was
bitter and sore and worried. “I cannot stay here with
Beverly this winter,” she continued. “I need not
explain any farther. Mrs. Peele will not consent to my
going to town with her. But couldn’t I live abroad?
I could do so on very little. I should care nothing for
society if I could live my life by myself. I should be
quite contented with books and freedom. But I cannot
stay here with Beverly alone again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele shook his head. “It wouldn’t do. I
understand; but it would only result in scandal, and I
don’t like scandal. We have never gone to pieces, like
so many great New York families. Our women have
been proud and conservative, and have not used their
position to cloak their amours. I have perfect confidence
in you, of course; but if you went to Europe and
left Beverly raging here, people would say that you had
gone to meet another man. Moreover, it would do no
good. Beverly would follow you. And he will give
you no cause for divorce: he has the cunning peculiar
to the person of ugly disposition and limited mentality.
No, try to stand it. Remember that all the humours
of human nature have their limit. Beverly will become
indifferent in time. Then he will let you come to us.
I intend to take a rest in a year or two and go abroad,
and I shall be glad to have you with us. I do not mind
telling you that you are the brightest young woman I
have ever known—and Mr. Field has said the same
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience was not in a mood to bend her neck to
flattery. She shook her head gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have any brain, cannot you see that I suffer the
more? Mr. Peele, I cannot stay here with Beverly!
Do you know that sometimes I have felt that I could
kill him? I am afraid of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Hush! Don’t say such things. You excitable
young women are altogether too extravagant in
your way of expressing yourselves. Words carry a great
deal farther than you have any idea of—take an old
lawyer’s word for it. Now try to stand it. In fact,
you must stand it. I’ll do all I can. I’ll leave a
standing order with Brentano to send you all the new
books, and I’ll insist upon your coming up every week
or so to have some amusement. But for God’s sake
make no scandal.”</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the first of December Patience and Beverly were
alone once more. The weather was fine, and Beverly
temporarily absorbed in breaking in a colt on his private
track. Patience spent the first day wandering about
the woods, tormented by her thoughts. She remembered
with passionate regret the old crystal woods
where she had been a girl of dreams and ideals. Her
ideals were in ruins. The hero of her dreams had told
her a hideous truth that had made her hate him and
more abundantly despise herself. She longed ardently
to get away to a mountain top, a hundred miles from
civilisation. Nature had been her friend in the old
Californian days, and the green or white beauty of her
second environment had satisfied her in that peaceful
intermediate time. But Westchester County, although
exquisitely pretty, lacked grandeur and the suggestion of
colossal throes in remote ages with which every stone in
California is eloquent. That was what she wanted now.
But there was no prospect of getting away. Did she
have enthusiasm enough left to leave summarily she
had little money. She was very extravagant, and left
the larger part of her quarterly allowance with New
York shops and milliners and dressmakers; but she
knew that the end was approaching, and listlessly
awaited it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavy with rebellious disgust she returned to the
house and went mechanically to the library. For a
while she did not read; she felt no impulse to do so.
But after a time she took down a book in desperation,
a volume of a new edition de luxe of “Childe
Harold.” She had not read it during her brief Byronic
fever, and had not opened the poet since. Gradually
she forgot self. She began with the third canto, and
when she had finished the fourth she discovered that
her spirits were lighter, a weight had risen from her
brain. She had always regarded “notes” as an evidence
of the amateur reader, but to-day she scrawled on
a fly-leaf of Mr. Peele’s new morocco edition:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“As the Christian goes to his God for help, the intellectual,
in hours of depression and disgust and doubt go
to the great Creators of Literature, those master minds
that lift our own temporarily above the terrible enigma of
the commonplace, and possess us to the extinction of
personal meditation. Are not these genii as worthy of deification
by the higher civilisation as was Jesus Christ—their
brother—by the great illogical suffering mass of mankind?
‘Faith shall make ye whole,’ said Christ; ‘come unto me,
all ye that are heavy laden.’ ‘Develop your brain, and I
will give you self-oblivion, philosophy, and a soul of many
windows,’ say the great masters of thought and style, the
stupendous creative imaginations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly came home in high good humour; his colt
had showed his blood, and nearly pulled him out of the
break-cart. Patience endeavoured to appear interested,
and he was so pleased that the atmosphere during
dinner was quite domestic. Afterward he went to
sleep on a sofa by the library fire, and his wife read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week passed more placidly than Patience had expected.
Beverly was evidently under stress to make
himself agreeable. His wife suspected that he had had
a long and meaning conference with his father. In
truth he was desperately afraid that she would leave
him. Patience did not know whether she hated him
most when he was amiable or violent; but she hated
herself more than she hated him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll go to town and see Rosita,” she
thought one morning as she awakened. “It seems to
me that she is the fittest companion I could find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the breakfast-table she appeared in a tailor frock
and turban, and informed Beverly that she was going to
town to pay some visits. Beverly looked at her for a
moment with black face, then dropped his eyes without
comment. He recalled his father’s advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What train shall you come home in?” he asked
after a moment. “I’ll go down to the station to meet
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say. I shall be back to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going to kiss me good-bye?” he asked
sullenly, when she was about to open the front door.
She hesitated a moment, then raised her face, closing
her eyes, lest he should see the impulse to strike him.
He saw the hesitation and turned away with an oath,
then ran after her, flung his arms about her and kissed
her. She walked down to the station with burning
face, rubbing her mouth and cheeks violently, careless
of the wide-eyed regard of two gardeners.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When she arrived at Rosita’s the maid admitted her
without protest, not recognising in this elegant young
woman the countrified girl of two years before. She
left Patience in the dark drawing-room, but returned in
a moment and announced that Madame would see Mrs.
Peele at once. Patience followed the woman through
the boudoir and bedroom to the bath-room, a classic
apartment of pink tiles. The tub was merely one corner
of the room walled off with tiles; and in it, covered
from throat to foot with a sheet, her head on a silken
strap, lay Rosita. By her side sat a girl in a fashionable
ulster and large hat, a note-book and pencil on
her lap. Rosita looked like a dark-haired Aphrodite,
and was as fresh as a rose. A maid had just dried one
pink and white hand, and she held it out to Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita! Patita! Patita!” she said with her sweet
drawl and accent, and without a trace of resentment in
her soft heavy eyes. “Where, where have you been all
these years? Miss Merrien, this is my oldest and
dearest friend, Mrs. Beverly Peele [she pronounced the
name with visible pride]. Patita, this is Miss Merrien
of the ‘Day.’ She is interviewing me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience flushed as she bent her head to the young
woman, who regarded her with conspicuous amazement,
and whose nostrils quivered a little, as if she scented a
“story.” She was a pretty girl with a dark rather worn
face, a frank eye, and a nervous manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita, sit down there just for a moment while I
look at you. Then we will go into the other room.
I could not wait to see you. <span class='it'>Dios de mi alma</span>, but you
have changed, Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>. Who would ever have
thought that you would be such a beauty and such a
swell. Gray cloth and chinchilla! Just think, Miss
Merrien, we used to wear sunbonnets and copper-toed
boots, and drove an old blind horse that would not go
off a walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I put that down?” asked the girl, eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please don’t,” exclaimed Patience. Miss Merrien’s
face fell. Then she smiled, and said good-naturedly,
“All right, I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now Patita is a swell,” pursued Rosita,
as if no interruption had occurred, “and I am a
famous <span class='it'>prima donna</span>. Such is life. Patita, do you
know that I have two hundred thousand dollars invested?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señorita!</span> Oh, my price has gone up, Patita
<span class='it'>mia</span>,” and she laughed her low delicious laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien smiled. “A man shot himself for that
laugh the other day—I suppose you read about it,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I did not. I have read the newspapers irregularly
of late—the ‘stories,’ at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” said Rosita, complacently. “Oh, Patita,
life is so lovely. To think that we both had such great
destinies! <span class='it'>Pobre</span> Manuela, and Panchita, and all the
rest! <span class='it'>Bueno</span>, go into the bedroom, both of you, and I
will be there in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience and Miss Merrien seated themselves in the
white bower of velvet and lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do not put me into your story,” said Patience,
hastily. “It would not do—you see my husband
would not like it—but we are old friends, and I
wanted to see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien nodded intelligently. With the suspicion
of her craft she leaped to the conclusion that the
fashionable young woman came to her disreputable
friend for an occasional lark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I promise you. If you hadn’t asked me I
should though. It would make a fine story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” said Patience abruptly, “do you like being
a newspaper woman? Is it very hard work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s hard work,” Miss Merrien answered in some
surprise; “but then it is the most fascinating, I do
believe, in the whole world. I have a family and a
home out West, and I could go back and be comfortable
if I wanted to; but I wouldn’t give up this life, with
all its grind and uncertainty, for that dead and alive
existence. I only go out there once a year to rest. I
came on here for an experiment, to see a little of the
world. I had a dreadful time catching on; once I
thought I’d starve, for I was bound I wouldn’t write
home for money; but I hung on and got there. And
I’m here to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is it really so pleasant? Sometimes I wish I
were a newspaper woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You? You? I never saw anybody that looked
less like one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very strong. I am naturally pale, that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, your skin is lovely: it’s that warm dead white.
I wasn’t thinking of that. But you look like the princess
that felt the pea under sixteen mattresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One adapts one’s self easily to luxury. I have
only had it two years. I do like it certainly. Nevertheless,
I’d like to be a newspaper woman. You look
tired; are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am, Mrs. Peele. It’s hard work, if it is
fascinating; for instance, I’ve chased about this entire
week for stories that haven’t panned out for a cent. I
haven’t made ten dollars. I came up here as a last
resource. La Rosita is always good-natured, and I
hoped she’d have a story for me. But all I’ve got is
a crank that’s following her about threatening to kill
her if she doesn’t marry him, and that’s such a chestnut.
If I could only fake something I know she’d let
it go, but my imagination’s worn to a thread—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The portière was pushed aside, and Rosita entered.
She wore a glistening night-robe of silk and lace and
ribbon under a yellow plush bath gown. Her dense
black hair fell to her knees. She slid into bed and
ordered her maid to admit the manicure. An old
woman, looking like a witch and clad in shabby black,
came in and took a chair beside the bed. The maid
brought a crystal bowl and warm water, and a golden
manicure set, and Rosita held forth her incomparable
arm with its little Spanish hand. She lay with indolent
grace among the large pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly are a beauty,” exclaimed Miss Merrien,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita smiled with much pleasure. “I love to hear
a woman say that, and I shall make good copy for
many years yet. I shall not fade like most Spanish
women. Oh, I have learned many secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you hadn’t told them to me, and then I
should still have them to write about. They made a
great story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dios! Dios!</span>” said Rosita, plaintively, “I wish we
could think of something. I hate to send you away
with nothing at all. I love to be written about. Patita,
can’t you think of something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mrs. Peele,” said Miss Merrien, “let us see
if you are a good fakir. That is one of the first essentials
of being a successful newspaper woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear! Is it? If I could fake I’d make books.
I’d like that even better. Rosita, did you ever tell
the newspapers about that time I coached you for your
first appearance on any stage, and the great hit you
made?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” asked Miss Merrien, sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought of it. Patita, you tell the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Patience did, while Miss Merrien wrote rapidly
in shorthand, pausing occasionally to exclaim with
rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my good angel sent me here this morning,”
she said when Patience had finished. “I won’t mention
your name, of course, but you won’t mind my saying
that you are one of the Four Hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose there is any objection. I am such
an obscure member of it that no one will suspect me.
Only don’t give any details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I won’t, indeed I won’t.” She slipped her
book into her muff and rose to go. “You don’t know
how much obliged I am. I’ll do as much for you some
day. If ever you want to be written up, let me know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never should want to be in the newspapers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s no telling. You haven’t had a taste of
it yet. Well, good-morning,” and she went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience leaned back in her luxurious chair, and
watched the old woman polish the pretty nails. Rosita
babbled, and Patience watched her face closely. Its
colouring was as fresh, its contours as perfect as ever, but
there was a faint touch of hardness somewhere, and the
eyes held more secrets than they had two years ago.
They were the eyes of the wanton. For a moment
Patience forgot her surroundings. Her mind flew back
to the old days, to the rickety buggy with the two contented
innocent little girls, then, by a natural deflection,
to her tower and her dreams. She longed passionately
for the old Mission, and wondered if Solomon were still
alive. Then she thought of Bourke, and came back to
the present with a shudder. The woman had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” asked Rosita. “Is it true—what
the men say—that you are not happy with your
husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate him,” said Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get a divorce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No grounds? Fancy a wife having no grounds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not the slightest doubt of his faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send him to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Rosita! How can you be so coarse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No-o-o-o! You are my old friend. I would do
anything for you. Think it over, Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not need to think it over. I would never do
so vile a thing as that. Have you no refinement left?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What earthly use would I have for refinement?
Patita, you are such a baby, and you always had ideals
and things. Have you got them yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patience, rising abruptly. “I haven’t.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Patita dear,” said Rosita, with unruffled
good humour, “and if ever you are in trouble come
here and I will take you in. I would even lend you
money, and if you knew me you would know how much
I loved you to do that. There is not another person
living I would give a five cent piece to.”</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience reached the sidewalk she filled her
lungs with fresh air, then looked at her watch. It was
only a half after twelve, and she decided to call on
Mary Gallatin. She had never yet paid that charming
young fashionette the promised morning call, although
she had attended one or two of her afternoon receptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told the coachman to drive to the house in Fifty-seventh
Street, then threw herself back on the seat and
laughed, a long unpleasant laugh. She tapped first one
foot and then the other, with increasing nervousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What fools we mortals be to cry for the unattainable,”
she said, addressing the little mirror opposite.
“Probably that young newspaper woman envies me
bitterly. So, doubtless, do many others. Why on
earth am I longing for what I’ll never find, instead of
making the best of a bad bargain and the most of my
position? I think I’ll find my way out of the difficulty
with the average woman’s solution: I’ll take a lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage stopped before a house with the breadth
of stoop which in New York means plentiful wealth.
She waited in the drawing-room while the cautious
butler went up to see if his mistress would receive this
stranger. He returned in a moment and conducted
her up to a door at the front of the house. Patience
entered a large room whose light was so subdued that for
a moment she could see only vaguely outlined forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Beverly, how dear of you,” cried a sweet
voice, and Patience groped her way round the angle of
a large bed and saw Mrs. Gallatin sitting against a
mass of pillows. “I’m so glad you came this morning.
I’m feeling so blue. I’ve twisted my foot, you know,
and my friends are so kind to me. Mr. Rutger, give
Mrs. Peele a chair. Mrs. Beverly, you know Mr.
Rutger and Mr. Maitland and Mr. Owen, do you not?
There is Leontine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three young men, who had risen as she entered,
bowed and resumed their seats. Mrs. Lafarge threw
her a kiss from the depths of a chair by the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sat down and glanced about her while Mrs.
Lafarge finished an anecdote she had been telling. Her
eyes became accustomed to the light, and in a moment
she saw things quite distinctly. The large room was furnished
in Empire style, the walls and windows and the
great mahogany and brass bedstead covered with crimson
satin damask. There were only a few pieces of
heavy furniture, in the room, but like the bed they
were magnificent. Each brass carving told a different
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gallatin, smiling, exquisite, wore a cambric
gown, less elaborate than Rosita’s but more dainty.
Her shining hair was drawn modishly to the top of her
head and confined with a pink porcelain comb, carved
into semblance of wild roses. A pink silk shawl slipped
from her shoulders. Another wild rose was at her
throat. On her hands she wore rubies only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story Mrs. Lafarge told was slightly naughty, and
all laughed heartily at its conclusion. Patience had
heard too many naughty stories in the last two years to
be shocked; but when one of the young men began
another he was promptly hissed down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going to tell that before Mrs. Beverly,”
said Mary Gallatin. “She is quite too frightfully
proper. But we’re awfully fond of her all the same,”
and she patted Patience’s hand while her lovely young
face contracted in a charming scowl. Patience wondered
if she had a lover—Mr. Gallatin was a dapper
little man—and if that was why she looked so happy.
She glanced speculatively at the men, and wondered if
she could fall in love with one of them. But they
were very ordinary New York youths of fashion, high of
shoulder, slow of speech, large of epiglottis, vacuous of
expression. She shook her head unconsciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what on earth are you thinking about?”
cried Mrs. Gallatin, with her silvery laugh. “That
wasn’t a shake of disapproval, was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no!” said Patience, hastily. “Something
occurred to me, and I forgot I was not alone. You
see, I am so much alone that I’ve even gotten into the
habit of thinking out loud.” She felt that she was a
restraint—the suppressed young man had relapsed
into moody silence—and, as soon as she reasonably
could, rose to go. Mrs. Gallatin kissed her warmly
and Mrs. Lafarge came forward and kissed her also;
but Patience detected a faint note of relief in their
voices, and went downstairs feeling more depressed
than ever. “There seems to be no place for me,” she
thought. “I must be out of tune with everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to her father-in-law’s house in Eleventh
Street and found Mrs. Peele and Honora gowned for
expected luncheon guests. The former apologised
coldly for not being able to ask her to join them, but
“there was only room in the dining-room for eight.”
Honora rippled regret, and Patience felt that she should
disgrace herself with tears if she did not get out of the
house. She went directly to the station, intending to
return home, but as the train approached Peele Manor
she turned her back squarely on the old house and
decided to go on to Mariaville and see Miss Beale.
She remembered with satisfaction that she knew at
least one wholesome thoroughly sincere woman, however
misguided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached the station she concluded to walk
to the house. She felt nervous and excited. Her
cheeks burned and her temples ached a little. She had
taken no nourishment that day but a cup of coffee and
a roll, and her head felt light. It was now two o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had gone a little more than half way she
lifted her eyes and saw Miss Beale coming toward her
with beaming face, one hand ready to wave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patience!” she cried, as they met. “I’m so
glad to see you. I’m just going to kiss you if it is on
the street. I can’t say I thought you’d forgotten me, for
you’ve sent me money for my poor every time I begged
for it; but I did think you’d never come to see me.”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had no excuse to offer, so wisely attempted
none, but returned Miss Beale’s embrace heartily.
The older woman’s face was brilliant with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, how pretty you have grown! What a
colour! I’m so glad to see you looking so well.
How happy dear Miss Tremont would be to see you
now. She was always afraid you would be delicate.
But we can’t wish her back, can we, Patience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use wishing anything undone. Where
are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where I am going to take you. Now, don’t ask
any questions, but just come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, hoping that the destination was a fair
where she could get luncheon, followed submissively,
and evaded Miss Beale’s personal inquiries as best she
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does the Temperance Cause get on?” she
asked at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just the same! Just the same!” said Miss
Beale, with a cheerful sigh. “One makes slow progress
in this wicked world; all we can do is to trust in the
Lord and do our humble best. Mariaville has three
new saloons, and the father of one of my scholars beat
him nearly to death the other day for coming to the
Loyal Legion class; but we’ll win in the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile are you as much interested as ever?”
asked Patience, curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my!” Miss Beale gave an almost hilarious
laugh. “Well, I should think so. How could I ever
lose interest in the Lord’s work? Why, I never even
get discouraged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has occurred to me, sometimes—since I have
been away and met all sorts of people—that if you
really were Temperance you might have more chance
of success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we were what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Temperance in the actual meaning of the word.
You’re not, you know; you’re teetotalists. That is the
reason you antagonise so many thousands of men who
might be glad to help you with their vote otherwise.
The average gentleman—and there are thousands upon
thousands of him—never gets drunk, and enjoys his
wine at dinner and even his whiskey and water. He
doesn’t see any reason why he shouldn’t have it, and
there isn’t any. It adds to the pleasures of life.
Those are the people that really represent Temperance,
and naturally they have no sympathy with a movement
that they consider narrow-minded and an unwarrantable
intrusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale shook her head vigorously. “It is a sin
to touch it!” she exclaimed, “and sooner or later they
will all be drunkards, every one of them. The blessing
of God is not on alcohol, and it should be banished
from the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was in a perverse and almost ugly mood.
“Tell me,” she said, “how do you reconcile your
animosity to alcohol with the story of Christ’s turning
the water into wine at the wedding feast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t wine,” said Miss Beale, triumphantly;
“it was grape juice. Wine takes days to ferment, so
the water couldn’t possibly have become wine all in a
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience burst into laughter. “But, Miss Beale, it
was a miracle anyhow, wasn’t it? If he could perform
a miracle at all it would have been as easy to make wine
out of water as grape juice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale shook her head emphatically and set her
lips. “I <span class='it'>know</span> that the Lord never would have offered
wine to anybody; but grape juice is delightful, and he
probably knew it, and they called it wine. That is all
there is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” exclaimed Patience, forgetting the Temperance
question, as Miss Beale turned into a path and
walked toward the side entrance of the First Presbyterian
Church, “are we going here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, this is just where we are going. There is a
special meeting of the Y’s and Christian Endeavourers
of Mariaville and White Plains and two or three other
places. Ah! I’ve caught you now, you naughty
girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience turned away her face and frowned heavily.
All her old dislike of religion, almost forgotten during
the past two years, surged up above the impulsion of
her fermenting spirit. She felt the old impatience, the
old intolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to go in there?” she asked. “I
came to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re not going to get out of it,” cried Miss
Beale, gayly. “And I know you better than you know
yourself. I know you always wanted to give yourself
to the Lord, only you are too proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stared at her, wondering if she had so far
forgotten herself as to indulge in a little joke at the
expense of her idols; but Miss Beale was looking at
her with kind, earnest eyes. Patience laughed, and
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll go in to please you; but I hope it won’t
be too long, for I’m horribly hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear! Why didn’t you come a little earlier?
But it won’t be more than two hours, and then I’ll have
a hot luncheon prepared for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led Patience through the large church parlour
and straight up to a table, lifting a chair as she passed
the front row of seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to sit here,” whispered Patience,
hurriedly; but Miss Beale pushed her into the chair, and
seated herself beside her, at the back of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to preside, and you are the guest of
honour,” she said. “Young ladies,” she continued,
smiling at the rows of bright and serious faces, “I
am sure you will all be glad to see Patience again. I
know she is glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience arose and bowed awkwardly, then sat down
and tapped the floor with her foot. The young women
looked surprised and pleased. One and all smiled
encouragingly, sure that she had been converted at last.
Many of the faces were bright with youth and even mischief;
others were careworn and aging. Not one of
them but looked happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience under her calm exterior began to seethe
and mutter once more. Once she almost laughed
aloud as she thought of the effect upon these simple-minded
girls if the hell within her were suddenly made
manifest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting opened at once. Miss Beale offered a
prayer, in which she implored that they all might love
the Lord the more. Hymns were sung, the Bible read,
and reports by the various secretaries and treasurers.
Then one serious and not unintelligent-looking woman
of thirty read a platitudinous paper beginning: “Some
one has said, ‘The time will come when it will be the
proudest boast of every man and woman to say “I am
an American.”’ I say that the time will come when it
will be the proudest boast of every man and woman to
say, ‘I am a Christian.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All regarded the reader with eyes of affection and
approval. Each word Patience, in her abnormal state
of mind, took as a personal insult to Intellect. She
felt furiously resentful that in this Nineteenth Century
with its educational facilities, its libraries full of the
achievements of great masters of thought, there should
be so low a standard of intellectuality in the middle
classes. Even the fashionable women, frivolous as they
were, were brighter, and keener to pierce outworn traditions.
They might not be thinkers, but they had a
species of lightning in their brain which rent superstition
and gave them flashlight glimpses of life in its true
proportions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls began to give experiences. One had just
joined the Y’s, and she related with tears the story of
her struggle between the World and the Church, and
her thankfulness that at last she had been permitted to
decide in favour of the Lord. Patience remembered
her as the vapid daughter of rather wealthy parents
who in her own day had been devoted to society and
young men. She was very faded. Many of the girls
wept in sympathy, and Miss Beale mopped her eyes
several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An extremely pretty girl stood up, a girl with black
hair and pale blue eyes and rich pink colour. Patience
regarded her satirically, thinking what a beauty she
would be if properly gowned. Miss Beale, noting her
interest, patted her hand and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just want to say,” began the girl, with deep earnestness,
“that every day of my life I have greater confidence
that the Lord loves me and hears what I ask
Him. You know that I write the reports of the Y. W.
C. T. U., and of course I have to get them printed for
nothing. So when I sit down to write them I just ask
the Lord to tell me what to say and how to say it, and
all the way to the office I keep asking Him to tell me
what to say to the editor so that he will print it and
help our great cause along. And, girls, he prints it every
time, and only yesterday he said to me: ‘I like your
stuff because it’s direct and to the point, no gush, no
rhetoric—it’s plain horse sense.’ Now, girls, you
need not think I say that to compliment myself. I
just say it to prove that the Lord writes those newspaper
articles, not I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience put her handkerchief to her face and shook
convulsively. She bit her lips to keep from laughing
aloud; she wanted to scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she became conscious of a deep murmur.
Supposing it to be of disapproval, she straightened her
mouth and dropped her handkerchief; but her face
was scarlet, her eyes full of tears. The girls were leaning
forward, regarding her earnestly. Miss Beale leaned
over and placed her arm about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak,” she said softly. “Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you thinking about?” gasped
Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us what is in your heart,” said Miss Beale, in
a tremulous voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, “Tell us! Tell us!” came from the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what you are saying,” said Patience,
freeing herself angrily. “Let me go.” She was trembling
with excitement. Her head felt very light. The
blood was pounding in her ears. She started to her
feet, meaning to rush to the door; but Miss Beale was
too quick for her. She caught her firmly by the waist
and led her to the middle of the space at the head of
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she will speak,” said Miss Beale. “Patience,
we all feel our awful responsibility. If you speak
out now, you will be saved. If your timidity overcomes
you, you may go hence and never hear His knock
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak! Speak!” came with solemn emphasis from
the Y’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I’ll speak,” cried Patience. “And suppose
you hear me out. It will be only polite, since
you have forced me to speak. You have always misunderstood
me. I am by no means indifferent to the
God you worship. I have the most exalted respect
and admiration for this tremendous creative force behind
the Universe, a respect so great that I should
never presume to address him as you do in your funny
little egoism. Do you realise that this magnificent
Being of whose essence you have not the most approximate
idea, is the Creator, not only of this but of countless
other worlds and systems, and furthermore of the
psychic and physical laws that govern them and of the
extraordinary mystery of which we are a part, and which
has its most subtle expression in the Space surrounding
us? And yet you, atoms, pigmies, tiny individual manifestations
of a great correlative force called human nature,
you presume to address this stupendous Being,
and stand up and kneel down and talk to It, to imagine
that It listens to your insignificant wants,—that It
writes newspaper articles! Is it Christianity that has
destroyed the sense of humour in its disciples?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In each of you is a shaft from the great dominating
Force—that is quite true, and it is for you to develop
that force—character—and rely upon it, not upon
a spiritual lover, as weak women do upon some unfortunate
man. What good does all this religious sentimentality
do you? Your brains are rotting. You have
nothing to talk about to intelligent men. No wonder
the men of small towns get away as soon as they can,
and seek the intelligent women of lower strata. Men
are naturally brighter than women, and girls of your
sort deliberately make yourselves as limited and colourless
as you can. Go, make yourselves companions for
men, if you would make the world better, if you must
improve the human race. Study the subjects that
interest them, that fill their life; study politics and the
great questions of the day, that you may lead them to
the higher ethical plane on which nature has placed
you. Quit this erotic sentimentalising over an abstract
being to whom you must be the profoundest joke of his
civilisation—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” shrieked Miss Beale. For some moments
Patience had been obliged to raise her voice above the
angry mutterings of her audience. One or two were
sobbing hysterically. Miss Beale’s cry was the signal
for the explosion of pent-up excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go! Go!” cried the girls. “Go out of this
church! Blasphemer! Shame! Shame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience looked out undaunted upon the sea of
flushed angry faces, which a few moments before had
been all peace and love. She shrugged her shoulders,
bowed to Miss Beale, who was staring at her with horrified
eyes in a livid face, and walked toward the door.
The girls pressed her forward, lest she should speak
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have a right as churchwomen to hate you,”
cried one, “for we are told to hate the devil, and you
are he incarnate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience refused to accelerate her steps, but reached
the door in a moment. As she was about to pass out
a joyous face was uplifted to hers. It belonged to a
girl still sitting. Her lap was piled with loose sheets
of paper. There was an excited smirch of lead on her
cheek. Even as she raised her head and spoke she
continued writing. “That was a corker,” she whispered,
“the biggest story I’ve had in weeks.” It was
Miss Merrien.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was an early riser, and had usually read the
“Day” through before Beverly lounged downstairs, sleepy
and cross and masculine. On the morning after her
day of varied experience she took the newspaper into
the library and read the first page leisurely, as was her
habit. The news of the world still interested her profoundly.
Then she read the editorials, and, later,
glanced idly at the headlines of the “stories.” The
following arrested her startled eye:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>AN EARTHQUAKE IN MARIAVILLE!</p>
<p class='line'>THE GOOD PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED!</p>
<p class='line'>A SENSATION BY THE BEAUTIFUL AND BRILLIANT</p>
<p class='line'>MRS. BEVERLY PEELE!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The story covered two thirds of a column. Patience
read it three times in succession without stopping to
comment. It was graphically told, much exaggerated,
and as carefully climaxed as dramatic fiction. And it
was interesting reading. Patience decided that if it
had not been about herself she should have given
it more than passing attention. Her beauty and grace
and elegance, her grand air, were described with enthusiasm.
Every possible point of contrast was made to
the serious and unfashionable Y’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Patience was horrified. She wondered what
Mr. and Mrs. Peele would say. Beverly’s comments
were not within the limitations of doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in for it,” she thought. Then she smiled.
She felt the same thrill she had experienced when the
men looked askance at her after her assault upon her
mother. The Ego ever lifts its head at the first caress,
and quickly becomes as insatiable as a child for sweets.
Patience glanced at the article to note how many times
her name—in small capitals—sprang forth to meet
her eyes. She imagined Bourke reading it, and Mrs.
Gallatin, and Mrs. Lafarge, and many others, and wondered
if strangers would find it interesting; then,
suddenly, she threw back her head and laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What fools we mortals be!” she thought. “And
the President of the United States has dozens of paragraphs
written about him every day. And actors and
writers are paragraphed <span class='it'>ad nauseam</span>. If a woman is
run over in the street she has a column, and if she goes
to a hotel and commits suicide, she has two, and is a
raving beauty. Rosita is persecuted for stories. The
Ego ought to have its ears boxed every morning, as
some old-fashioned people switch their children. Well,
here comes Beverly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband entered, and for the first time in many
months she sprang to her feet and gave him a little
peck on his cheek. He was so surprised that he
forgot to pick up the newspaper, and followed her at
once into the dining-room. During the meal she
talked of his horses and his farm, and even offered
to take a drive with him. He was going to White
Plains to look at some blooded stock which was to be
sold at auction, and promptly invited her to accompany
him; but her diplomacy had its limits, and she declined.
However, he went from the table in high good humour.
When she left him in the library, a few moments later,
he was arranging the scattered sheets of the “Day,”
without his accustomed comments upon “the infernal
manner in which a woman always left a newspaper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience went up to her room and wrote a note of
apology to Miss Beale. She was half way through a
long letter to Hal when she heard Beverly bounding up
the stair three steps at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cyclone struck Peele Manor at 10.25,” she
said, looking at the clock. “Sections of the fair—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly burst in without ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell does this mean?” he cried, brandishing
the newspaper. His dilating nostrils were livid.
The rest of his face was almost black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beverly, you will certainly have apoplexy or burst
a blood vessel,” said his wife, solicitously. “Think of
those that love you and preserve yourself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those that love me be damned! The idea of my
wife—<span class='it'>my wife</span>—being the heroine of a vulgar newspaper
story! Her name out in a headline! Mrs.
Beverly Peele! My God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God was the cause of the whole trouble,” said
Patience, flippantly. “I thought the young women
were entirely too intimate with him. The spectacle
conjured of The Almighty with his sleeves rolled up
grinding out copy at five dollars per column was too
much for me. I have the most profound admiration
and respect for the Deity, and felt called upon to
defend him—the others seemed so unconscious of
insult—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no subject for a joke,” cried Beverly, who
had sworn steadily through these remarks. “I don’t
care a hang if you had a reason or not for making a
public speech—Christ!—it’s enough that you made
it, that your name’s in the paper—my wife’s name!
What will my father and mother say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not swear. A few of the Peeles are
decently well bred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one ever gave them cause to swear before.
You’ve turned this family upside down since you came
into it. You’ve been the ruin of my life. I wish to
God I’d never seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sincerely wish you hadn’t. What had you intended
to make of your life that I have interfered
with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d married a woman who loved me I’d have
been a better man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how many weak men have said that since
the world began! You were twenty-six when I married
you, and I cannot see that there has been any change in
kind since, although there certainly is in degree. If
you had married the ordinary little domestic woman,
you would have been happier, but you would not have
been better, for you possess neither soul nor intelligence.
But I am perfectly willing to give you a chance
for happiness. Give me my freedom, and look about
you for a doll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say that you want a divorce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you know just how much I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you won’t get it—by God! Do you understand
that? You’ve no cause, and you’ll not get
any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There should be a law made for women who—who—well,
like myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband was incapable of understanding her.
“Well, you just remember that,” he said. “You don’t
get a divorce, and you keep out of the newspapers, or
you’ll be sorry,” and he slammed the door and strode
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quarter of an hour after Patience heard the wheels
of his cart. At the same time the train stopped below
the slope. A few moments later she saw Miss Merrien
come up the walk. The maid brought up the visitor’s
card, and with it a note from Mr. Field.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Mrs. Beverly</span> [it read],—Forgive me—but you
are a woman of destiny, or I haven’t studied people sixty
years for nothing. I chose to be the first—the scent of
the old war-horse for news, you know. Peele will be
furious, but I can’t bother about a trifle like that. Just give
this young woman an interview, and oblige your old
friend</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>J. E. F.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience started to go downstairs, then turned
to the mirror and regarded herself attentively. She
looked very pretty, remarkably so, as she always did
when the pink was in her cheeks; but her morning
gown was plain and not particularly becoming. She
changed it, after some deliberation, for a house-robe
of pearl grey silk with a front of pale pink chiffon
hanging straight from a collar of cut steel. The maid
had brought her some pink roses from the greenhouse;
she fastened one in the coil of her soft pale hair.
Then she smiled at her reflection, shook out her train,
and rustled softly down the stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien exclaimed with feminine enthusiasm as
she entered the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are the loveliest woman to write about,”
she said. “I do a lot of society work; and I am so
tired of describing the conventional beauty. And that
gown! I’m going to describe every bit of it. Did it
come from Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Patience, amused at her immediate success.
“My mother-in-law brought it to me last summer—but
perhaps you had better not mention Mrs.
Peele in your story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t, of course, if you don’t want me to.
I have written the story about La Rosita for the Sunday
‘Day,’ and I did not hint at your identity. It made
a good story, but not as good as the one about you.
Mr. Field wrote me a note this morning, complimenting
me, and told me to come up here and interview
you. I hope you don’t mind very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t the faintest idea whether I do or not.
How do you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, I’ll just ask you questions and you
answer them, and I’ll put it all down in shorthand, and
then when I go to the office I’ll thresh it into shape.
You can be sure that I won’t say anything that isn’t
pleasant, for I really never admired any one half so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, you interview me, and then I’ll interview
you. I have some questions to ask also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you anything you like. This story, by
the way, is to be in the Sunday issue on the Woman’s
Page. Now we’ll begin. Were you always an unbeliever?
Tell me exactly what are your religious
opinions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear me! You are not going to write a serious
analysis of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I’ll give it the light touch so that it won’t
bore anybody. It is to be called ‘A Society Woman
Who Thinks,’ and will be read with interest all over
America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not a society woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a swell, and that’s the same thing, for
this purpose anyhow. The Gardiner Peeles are out of
sight, and I have heard lots of times how beautifully
you entertain in summer and how charmingly you gown
yourself. Tell me first—what do you think of this
everlasting woman question? I hate the very echo of
the thing, but we’ll have to touch on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I haven’t given much thought to it, except as
a phase of current history. One thing is positive, I
think: we must adjust our individual lives without
reference to any of the problems of the moment,—Womanism,
Socialism, the Ethical Question, the Marriage
Question, and all the others that are everlasting
raging. He that would be happy must deal with the
great primal facts of life—and these facts will endure
until human nature is no more. Moreover, however
much she may reason, nothing can eradicate the strongest
instinct in woman—that she can find happiness
only through some man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Miss Merrien. “I’d have thought the
same thing if I’d ever had time. Now tell me if you
have any religion at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I should be called an anarchist. Don’t
be alarmed: I mean the philosophical or spiritual anarchist,
not these poor maniarchists that are merely an
objectionable variety of lunatics. The religious situation
is this, I think: Jesus Christ does not satisfy the
intellectual needs of the Nineteenth Century. And
yet, indisputably, the religionists are happier than the
multiplying scores that could no more continue in the
old delusion than they could worship idols or torture
the flesh. Civilisation needs a new prophet, and he
must be an anarchist,—one who will teach the government
of self by self, the government of man’s nature by
will, which in its turn is subservient to the far seeing
brain. Human nature is anarchic in its essence. The
child never was born that was brought to bend to
authority without effort. We are still children, or we
should not need laws and governments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till I get that down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course these are only individual opinions. I
don’t claim any value for them, and should never have
thought of airing them if you hadn’t asked me. For
my part I’m glad I live in this imperfect chaotic age.
When we can all do exactly as we please and won’t
even remember how to want to do anything wrong—Awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said the advanced thinkers needed this
new religion to make them happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their happiness will consist in the tremendous
effort to reach the difficult goal. That will take centuries,
just as the spiritualised socialism of Jesus Christ
has taken twenty centuries, and only imperfectly possessed
one third of the globe. When anarchy is a cold
hard fact—well, I suspect the anarchists will suddenly
discover that <span class='it'>ennui</span> is in their vitals, and will gently
yawn each other to death. Then the tadpoles will
begin over again; or perhaps there will then be mental
and moral developments that we in our present limitations
cannot conceive. Haven’t you had enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no. I’ve a dozen questions more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien, like all good newspaper reporters, was
an amateur lawyer and a harmless hypnotist. In an
hour she had extracted Patience’s views of society,
books, dress, public questions, and the actors in the
great national theatre, the Capitol at Washington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this is magnificent,” she announced, when the
pages had been folded. “Now can I look at the
house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will have luncheon first. No, don’t protest.
I am delighted. Mr. Peele is away for the day,
otherwise I fear you would not have had this interview.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t believe in the submission of wives,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never thought much about it,” said Patience,
indifferently. “There is too much fuss made about it
all. When a man commands his wife to do a thing she
does not care to do, and when a woman does what she
knows will displease her husband, it is time for them to
separate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that is too simple. It wouldn’t do to reduce
the woman question to a rule of three. What
would all the reformers do? And the poor polemical
novelists! Oh, these are the famous portraits, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can look at them if the luncheon is bad,” said
Patience, as they took their seats at table. “I’m not
a very good housekeeper, although I actually did take
some lessons of Miss Mairs. And sometimes I forget
to order luncheon. I did to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the luncheon proved to be a very good one, and
Miss Merrien did it justice, while Patience explained
the portraits. Afterward she showed her guest over the
lower part of the house. Then they went back to the
library, and Patience had her interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me exactly how does a woman begin on a
newspaper?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, different ones have different experiences,” said
Miss Merrien, vaguely. “Sometimes you have letters,
and are put on as a fashion or society reporter, or to
get interviews with famous women, or to go and ask
prominent people their opinion on a certain subject—for
a symposium, you know; like ‘What Would
You do if You Knew that the World was to End in
Three Days?’ or, ‘Is Society Society?’ I have written
dozens of symposiums. Sometimes you do free-lance
work, just pick up what you can and trust to luck
to catch on. But of course you must have the nose for
news. I was at a matinée one day and sat in front of
two society women. Between the acts they talked about
a prominent woman of their set who was getting a divorce
from her husband so quietly that no newspaper
had suspected it. They also joked about the fact that
her lawyer was an old lover. I knew this was a tip, and
a big one. I wrote all the names on my cuff, and before
the matinée was over I was down at the ‘Day’ and
had turned in my tip to the City editor. He sent a
reporter to the lawyer to bluff him into admitting the
truth. The next day we had a big story, and after that
the editor gave me work regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you make a week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes forty, sometimes not twenty; but I average
pretty well and get along. Still, when you have to
lay by for sickness and vacations, and put about one
half on your back it doesn’t amount to much. You
see, a newspaper woman must dress well, must make a
big bluff. If she doesn’t look successful she won’t be,
to say nothing of the fact that she couldn’t get inside
a smart house if she looked shabby. And then she’s
got to eat good nourishing food, or she never could
stand the work. Of course there’s got to be economy
somewhere, so I live in a hall bedroom and make my
own coffee in the morning. Still, I don’t complain,
for I do like the work. If I had to go back home I’d
ruin the happiness of the entire family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you look forward to?—I mean what
ultimate? You don’t want to be a reporter always,
I suppose. Everybody is striving for some top
notch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, maybe I’ll become Sunday editor, or I might
fall in with somebody that wanted to start a woman’s
newspaper, or magazine—you never can tell. There
aren’t many good berths for women. Of course there
are a good many very bright newspaper women, and it’s
a toss up who goes to the top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to take matrimony into consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t deny I get so tired sometimes that I’d
be only too glad to have a man take care of me. I
guess we all look forward to that, more or less. I think
I’d always work, but not so hard. It would make all
the difference in the world if you knew some one
else was paying the bills. And then, you see, we go to
pieces in eight or ten years. A man is good for hard
newspaper work until he’s forty, but we women are
made to be taken care of, and that’s a fact. We take
turns having nervous prostration. I haven’t had it
yet, but I’m looking cheerfully forward to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I want to tell you,” said Patience, “that I am
going to be a newspaper woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nonsense, Mrs. Peele! Excuse me, but you
belong here. Your rôle is that of the châtelaine in
exquisite French gowns and an air half of languor, half
of pride. You were not made for work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is very pretty, but I suspect you don’t want
to lose me for copy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t deny it. I wish you’d keep the ball
rolling, and give me a story a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ve given you my last. In a week or
two I shall be a châtelaine in a pink and grey gown no
longer, but a humble applicant for work in Mr. Field’s
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible that you mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I look as if I were joking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look unhappy—Pardon me—but—but—does
he beat you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Patience, laughing outright, “he
doesn’t beat me. I have better grounds for desertion
than that. Do you think you would do me a favour?
I shall have to slip away. He would never let me go
with a trunk. I am going to ask you to let me send
you a box of things every few days. That will excite
no comment among the servants, as we are always
sending clothes to the poor. May I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you may. I’ll do everything I can to
help you. But—I can’t imagine you out of this environment.
Don’t you hate to give it up,—all this
luxury, this ease, this atmosphere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I like it all. I’m a sybarite, fast enough.
But I’ve weighed it all in the balance, and Peele Manor
stays up. I have a hundred dollars or so, and that will
last me for a time. I’ll give it to you to take care of
for me. I never was wealthy, but I have no idea of
economy. I don’t think I should like a hall room
though. Are the others so very expensive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are if you have a good address, and that’s
very important. And you want to be in a house with a
handsome parlour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no friends,—none that will come to see
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ll make friends. You’re an awfully sweet
woman. I can’t bear to think—Well, there’s no
use saying any more about it. I expect you’re the
sort that knows your own mind. I should like to keep
on seeing you a great lady, but if you can’t be a happy
one I suppose you are right. Well, I’ll stand by you
through thick and thin, and I’ll show you the ropes.
Now I must get back to the office and work up my
story. Here’s my address. There’s a spare room
on the floor above mine. If you’re in dead earnest
I’d better take it right away; then I can unpack your
things and hang them up. But—but—do you really
mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Mr. Field personally, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, indeed; and he told me when I was
sixteen that he should make a newspaper woman of
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, then, you’ll have a lot of push, and your
road won’t be as hard as some—not by a long <a id='shot'></a>shot.
About six out of every ten newspaper women either go
to the wall or to the bad. It is a mixture of knack
and pluck as much as brains that carries the favoured
minority through. You have brains and pluck, and
you’ll have push, so you ought to get there. About
the knack of course I can’t tell. Good-bye.”</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The evening mail brought from Mrs. Peele to her son a
note which he read with a rumbling accompaniment,
then tossed to Patience.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to permit your wife to disgrace your
family?” it read. “If I had my way that abominable
paper, the ‘Day,’ should never enter this house—nor any
other paper that dealt in personalities. I literally writhe
every time I see my name—your father’s honoured name—in
the society columns. You may, then, perhaps, imagine
my feelings when your father handed me the ‘Day’
this morning with his finger on that outrageous column.
He was speechless with wrath, and will personally call Mr.
Field to account. I am in bed with a violent headache, in
consequence, and dictating this letter to Honora. But
although I deeply feel for you, my beloved son, I must
<span class='it'>insist</span> that you assert your authority with your wrong-headed
wife and command her to refrain from disgracing
this family. I don’t wish to reproach you, but I cannot
help saying that it is <span class='it'>always</span> a dangerous experiment to
marry beneath one. This girl is not one of us, she never
can be; for, not to mention that we know nothing whatever
of her family, she comes from that dreadful savage <span class='it'>new</span>
Western country. In spite of the fact that she has been
clever enough to superficially adapt herself to our ways, I
always knew that she would break out somewhere—I
always said so to Honora. But I don’t wish to add to
your own sorrow. I know how you, with all your proud
Peele reserve, must feel. Only, my son, use your authority
in the future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience finished this letter with a disagreeable lowering
of the brows. She made no comment, however,
but opened a book and refused to converse with her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sunday morning she found three columns on the
Woman’s Page of the “Day” devoted to her beauty,
her intellect, her gowns, and her opinions. It was
embellished with a photograph of Peele Manor and a
sketch of herself, which Miss Merrien had evidently
made from memory. When Beverly came down she
handed the newspaper to him at once, to read the story
with the raw temper of early morning. She hoped that
Mrs. Peele would read it in similar conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone through the headlines he let the
newspaper fall to the floor, and stared at her with a
face so livid that for a moment she felt as if looking
upon the risen dead. Then gradually it blackened,
only the nostrils remaining white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you deliberately defy me?” he articulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, watching him narrowly. She
thought that he might strike her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did it on purpose to drive me crazy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no object whatever, except that it pleased
me to be interviewed. Understand at once that I shall
do exactly as I please in all things. This is not the
country for petty household tyrants. I don’t doubt
there are many men in this world whom I should be
glad to treat with deference and respect if I happened
to be married to one of them; but with men like you
there is only one course to take. I have asked you
to let me live abroad. If you consent to this, it may
save you a great deal of trouble in the future; for, I
repeat, I shall in all things do exactly as I choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see whether you will or not,” he roared.
“You’ll do as I say, or I’ll lock you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you will not lock me up. You are way
behind your times, Beverly. There is no law in
the United States to compel me to obey you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop your allowance. You’ll never get another
cent from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That has nothing whatever to do with it. Now, I
ask you for the last time, Will you let me travel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” he shouted, and he rushed from the room.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='book4'></a>BOOK IV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien lived in West Forty-fourth Street, near
Broadway. Ten days after her visit to Peele Manor
Patience rang the door-bell of the house that was to be
her new home, one of a long impersonal row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid that answered her ring handed her a note
from Miss Merrien, and conducted her up to a hall
room on the third floor. Patience closed the door,
and looked about her with the sensation of the shipwrecked.
For a moment she was strongly tempted to
flee back to Peele Manor. The room was about eight
feet square, and furnished with a folding-bed, which
was likewise a bureau, and with a washstand, a table,
and two chairs. The furniture and carpet were new,
and there were pretty blue and white curtains on the
window. Nevertheless the tiny room with its modern
contrivances was the symbol of poverty and struggle
and an entirely new existence. Her second impulse
was to sit down on a chair and cry; but she set her
teeth, and read Miss Merrien’s note instead.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>I am so sorry not to be able to meet you [it read];
but I am a slave, you know. Before I was out of bed
this morning I received an assignment to go to a woman’s
club meeting at eleven. But I’ll get back in time to go
down to the shop with you. Don’t get blue—if you can
help it. Remember that every woman feels the same way
when she first makes the break for self-support; and that
your chances are better than those of most. There’s a
little restaurant round the corner—the maid will show you—where
you can get your luncheon. <span class='it'>Au revoir.</span> I’m so
glad the sun is out.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Anna Chetwynde Merrien.</span></p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>P. S. Your clothes are in the closet in the hall. The
key is in the washstand drawer.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience felt in better cheer after reading Miss
Merrien’s kindly greeting, but the day dragged along
very heavily. She went out and bought all the newspapers,
and studied them attentively for hints; but
they did not tell her inexperience anything, and after
a time she let them fall to the floor and sat staring at
the blank windows opposite. For the first time doubts
assailed her. She had been so full of young confidence,
and pride in her brains and health and courage, that
she had not regarded the issue of her struggle with the
world in the light of a problem; but face to face with
the practical details, she felt short of breath and weak
in the knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two o’clock Miss Merrien came in, looking very
tired. There were black scoops under her eyes, and
the lines about her mouth were strongly accentuated.
But she smiled brightly as Patience rose to greet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are here,” she said. “I changed my
mind fifty times about your coming, but on the whole
I thought you would. Fortunately I have nothing on
hand for this afternoon. I’ll rest, and then go down
with you to the shop. Oh, I am so tired, my dear.
Can I lie down on your bed awhile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted to learn how to open it,” said
Patience, who was wondering if her fair face was to
become scooped and lined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien deftly manipulated the bed, loosened
her frock, and flung herself full length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spent all day yesterday and half the night tramping
over Brooklyn hunting up facts in the case of that
girl who was found dead in a tenement-house bed in a
grand ball gown. A great story that, but it has done
me up. Tell me—how do you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m glad I’m here, but I wish it was six
months from now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you do. That’s the way we all feel.
But you’ll soon swing into place, and be too busy to
think. I do wish you could get work in the office, so
that you could keep regular hours and meals, and not
lose your good looks; but there’s no berth of that sort.
I tell you it is a sad day when a girl under twenty-five
sees the lines coming. The Revolting Sisterhood say
that the next century is to be ours; but I doubt it.
Men lighten our burdens a little now, but I’m afraid
they’ll hate us if we worry and supplant them any
further. Well, I’m going to take a nap. Wake me
promptly at 3.10.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed her eyes and fell asleep immediately.
The lines grew fainter as she slept, and the hair fell
softly about her face. Patience reflected gratefully that
three months of absolute leisure and peace of mind
would give back to the girl all her freshness and
rounded contours. At ten minutes past three she
awakened her. Miss Merrien sat up with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel better, though. Cultivate those cat-naps.
They refresh you wonderfully. Now, we’ll go.”</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>They went down town on the Elevated, leaving it at
Park Row. Patience was so much interested in the
great irregular mass of buildings surrounding City Hall
Square, at the dense throngs packing the crooked side
streets, at the fakirs with their nonsensical wares, at the
bewildering array of gilt newspaper names on the rows
and stories of polished windows, that she forgot her
errand for the moment, and was nearly run over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, this is the heart of New York, sure enough,”
assented Miss Merrien. “All those big buildings over
there are on the famous Newspaper Row. Brooklyn
Bridge is just behind. This is the Post Office on the
right, and that flat building in the square is the City
Hall. I tell you when you get down here, the rest
of New York, including all the smart folk, seems pretty
insignificant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” exclaimed Patience, with a sudden sinking of
the heart, “there is the ‘Day’ building.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is our shop. Now, brace up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience needed the admonition. She forgot City
Hall Park. All her doubts returned, with others in
their wake. She knew something of the snobbery of
the world. As Mrs. Beverly Peele she had been an
object of respectful interest to Mr. Field. What would
she be as an applicant for work? True, he had been
kind to her when she was a small nobody, but that
might have been merely a caprice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed up two narrow stairs in an ugly old
building, and entered a large gas-lit room full of desks.
Many young men were writing or moving about; several
were in their shirt sleeves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the City room,” said Miss Merrien, “and
these are the reporters. Those men in that little room
there are the editors and editorial writers. Mr. Field’s
room is just beyond. Now send your card in by this
boy. The Chief’s harder to see than the President of
the United States, but I guess he’ll see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience gave the boy her card, and at the end of
half an hour, during which she was much stared at by
some of the men and totally ignored by others, the boy
returned and conducted her to Mr. Field’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a typical editor’s den of the old-fashioned
type. A big desk covered with papers, a revolving chair,
and one other chair completed the furniture. A large
cat was walking about, switching its tail. The floor was
bare. The light straggled down between the tall
buildings surrounding, and entered through small windows.
It was Mr. Field’s pride to have the greatest
newspaper and the most unpretentious “shop” in
the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose as Patience entered, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, as he handed her the extra chair,
“there’s a mighty row on, isn’t there? Peele has
been here, and now we do not speak as we pass by. But
we hadn’t had a good woman sensation for a month.
I tried to explain that to Peele, but it didn’t seem to
impress him. I suppose you’ve come to beg for
mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I haven’t come for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what is the matter? I never saw you look
the least bit rattled before. You are always the young
queen with a court of us old fellows at your feet. But
tell me; you know there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you make it easier—I’ve been horribly
frightened. But I’ll get to the point—I suppose
you’re very busy down here. Can I have ten
minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “We are usually what you might call
busy in this office, but you may have twenty minutes.
Take your time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s this: I’ve left Peele Manor for good and
all, and I want to be a newspaper woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Field’s shaggy white brows rushed up his forehead.
His black eyes expanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! What did you make such a break as
that for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many reasons. I can’t give them all.
But all the same I’ve left, and I’m not going back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your reasons must be good, for you had a
delightful position, and you became it. Are you sure
you are not acting rashly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thought and thought and thought about it. I
can’t understand why I didn’t leave before. I suppose
my ideas and intentions didn’t crystallise until I met
Miss Merrien. She has been very kind. I sent my
clothes to her by degrees; she engaged a room for me
in her house; we are going to cook together; and I
have given her what money I have to take care of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, you have acted deliberately. I don’t
know that I am so much surprised, after all, and I’ll
say nothing to persuade you to go back. I respect
your courage and independence, and I’ll do all I can.
I haven’t the slightest idea what you can do, but we’ll
find out.” He leaned forward and patted her hand.
Patience had one moment of painful misgiving, but
again she had misjudged him. “If you get discouraged,
just remember that the old man at the helm is your
friend and won’t let you go under.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you’re awfully good,” said Patience,
tears of contrition and gratitude in her eyes. “I knew
you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Field touched a bell. A boy entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mr. Steele is still in the office ask him to step
here,” said the chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steele is the editor of the Evening ‘Day,’” he explained,
“and has a remarkable faculty for discovering
other people’s abilities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience expected to see a man of middle years and
business-like demeanour. She stared in amazement as
a young man under thirty entered and was presented.
He was closely built, but held himself carelessly. His
smooth rather square face was very pale, and despite
the irregularity of feature, bore an odd resemblance
to the Greek fauns. The mouth was large and full, the
eyes large, dark blue, and very cold. His fashionable
attire accentuated the antiquity of his face and head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Steele,” said Mr. Field, “this is Mrs. Beverly
Peele, of whom you have heard so much lately. She
has made up her mind to support herself. When she
was a little girl I told her that I should one day make
a newspaper woman of her, and she has come to hold
me to my word—much to my satisfaction. I put her
in your hands, and feel confident you will make a success
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience expected to see a look of blank surprise
cross the young editor’s face, but she did not know the
modern newspaper youth. Mr. Steele could not have
displayed less emotion had the new-comer been a young
woman with letters from Posy County, Illinois. He
merely bowed to her, then to his chief. Patience rose
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t keep you,” she said to Mr. Field. “I’ll
only thank you again, and promise to work as hard as
Miss Merrien.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t the slightest doubt of your success.
Always remember that,” said Mr. Field. Patience saw
Mr. Steele’s eyebrow give a slight involuntary jerk;
but it was immediately controlled, and he bowed her
through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better go upstairs to the evening room,”
he said. “There is no one there at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience followed him up a precipitous stairway into
a walled-off section of the composing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” he said politely, but Patience for the
first time in her life felt terrified and humble. This
young man, of whom she had never heard before, had
the air of a superior being, omnipotent in her destiny.
His manner conveyed that he was not one whit impressed
by the fact that she had stepped down from the
Sacred Reservation, took not the faintest interest in
her as a pretty woman. She was merely a young
person particularly recommended by his chief, and as
such it was his duty to give her consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a chair opposite her own, and she felt as if
those classic guileless eyes were exploring her innermost
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can you do?” he asked coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” she said desperately, “absolutely
nothing. I suppose you feel like remarking that the
‘Day’ is not a kindergarten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it certainly is not. Nevertheless, as Mr. Field
thinks that you have ability, and wishes you to write for
his paper, I, of course, shall do all I can to abet him.
I shall begin by giving you a few words of advice.
Have you a good memory; or should you prefer to
write them down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke very slowly, as if he had a deep respect
for the value of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have read a great deal,” said Patience, proudly,
“and my memory is very good indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a faint twitching of one corner of Mr.
Steele’s mouth, but he continued in the same business-like
tone:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read the ‘Day’ through carefully, morning and
evening. Observe the style in which facts are presented,
and the general tone and atmosphere of the paper.
Cultivate that general style, not your own. Remember
that you are not on this newspaper to make an individual
reputation, but to become, if possible, a unit of a harmonious
whole, and to give the public the best news
in the style to which this newspaper has accustomed it.
When you are sent on an assignment remember that
you are to gather facts—facts. Keep your eyes open,
and cultivate the faculty of observation for all it is worth.
When you have gathered these facts put them into as
picturesque a shape as you choose—or as you can. But
no rhetoric, no rhapsodies, no flights, no theories. If
the facts admit of being treated humorously, treat them
in that way, by all means,—that is, if you can imitate a
man’s humour, not a woman’s flippancy. A good many
women can. And never forget that it must not be your
humour but the inherent humour of the subject. Be
concise. When you feel disposed to say a thing in ten
words say it in five. That is all I can think of at
present. Be here at eight o’clock to-morrow, and I will
give you an assignment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, and Patience felt herself dismissed. She
sat for a minute looking at him with angry eyes. Not
even in the early days of her married life had she been
so patronised as by this unknown young man. She felt
as if he had plucked her individuality out with his thumb
and finger and contemptuously tossed it aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?” he asked indifferently,
although one corner of his mouth twitched again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” Patience sprang to her feet and ran down
the stair, at the imminent risk of breaking her neck.
Miss Merrien was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what on earth is the matter?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let us get out into the air! Come, and then
I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were not able to converse until seated in the
Elevated Train. Then Patience exclaimed with an
accent of cutting sarcasm,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who, <span class='it'>who</span> is Mr. Steele?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien smiled broadly. “Oh, I see. Did he
patronise you? You must get used to editors. Remember
they are monarchs in a small way, and love their
power—the more because their dominion is confined
within four walls. But Morgan Steele is one of the
kindest men in the office. I’d rather work for him
than for any one. He puts on an extra amount of side
on account of his youth, but the reporters all adore him.
He won’t keep an incompetent man two days, and
during those two days the man’s life is a burden; but
he is always doing good turns to the boys he likes.
When you know him you’ll like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think him an insolent young cub, and if I didn’t
hate to bother Mr. Field I’d refuses to write for him.
What on earth is a youngster like that in such a responsible
position for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, this is the young man’s epoch. Just
cast your eyes over the United States and even England,
and think of the men under thirty that are editors
and authors and special writers and famous artists and
leaders of enterprises. They are burnt out at forty, but
they begin to play a brilliant part in their early twenties.
I heard a man say the other day of another man who
is only twenty-six and supposed to be ambitious:
‘Well, he’d better hump himself. He’s no chicken.’
A man feels a failure nowadays if he hasn’t distinguished
himself before thirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are certainly distinguished for conceit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, when you get used to newspaper men you’ll
like them better than any men you’ve known. What
is objectionable is counteracted by their brains and
their intimate and wonderfully varied knowledge of life.
A newspaper man who is at the same time a gentleman,
is charming. It is true they have no respect for anybody
nor anything. They believe in no woman’s virtue
and no man’s honesty—under stress. Their kindness—like
Morgan Steele’s—is half cynical, and they look
upon life as a thing to be lived out in twenty years—and
then dry rot or suicide. But no men know so well
how to enjoy life, know so thoroughly its resources, or
have all their senses so keenly developed, particularly
the sense of humour, which keeps them from making
fools of themselves. No man can feel so strongly for a
day, and that after all is the philosophy of life. All
this makes them very interesting, although, I must confess,
I should hate to marry one. It seems to be a
point of honour among them to be unfaithful to their
wives; however, I imagine, the real reason is that no
one woman has sufficient variety in her to satisfy a man
who sees life from so many points of view daily that he
becomes a creature of seven heads and seven hearts
and seven ideals. Now, tell me all about your interviews
with Mr. Field and Morgan Steele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience told the tale, and Miss Merrien raised her
eyebrows at its conclusion. “Well, you need not lie
awake nights trembling for the future. You are in for
push and no mistake. If the Chief has taken you under
his wing in that fashion you can be sure that Morgan
Steele will work you for all that is in you, whether he
wants to or not.” Suddenly she laughed, and leaning
over looked quizzically at Patience. “You vain girl,”
she said, “you are piqued because Morgan Steele did
not succumb as other men—including Mr. Field—have
done to your beauty and charm. But I’ll tell you
this, by way of consolation: it is a point of etiquette—or
prudence—among editors never to pay the most
commonplace attentions to, or manifest the slightest
interest in the women of the office. It would not only
lead to endless complications, but would impair the
lordlings’ dignity: in other words, they would be guyed.
So cheer up. You haven’t gone off since this morning.
I see three men staring at you in true Elevated
style.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience laughed. “Well, I will admit that I have
no respect whatever for a man that is unappreciative of
the charms of woman. I’d like to give Mr. Steele a
lesson, but I won’t. I wouldn’t condescend. I’ll be
as business-like as he is. He knew why I was angry to-day,
I am afraid, but he won’t see me angry again.
Why is Mr. Field so much nicer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he owns the paper.”</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience’s indignation had worn itself out by bedtime.
When Miss Merrien left her for the night she locked her
door and spread her arms out with an exultant sense of
freedom. She seemed to feel the ugly weight of the
past two years fall from her, and to hear it go clattering
down the quiet streets. Her sense of humour and the
liveliness of her mind had saved her from morbidity at
any time, although she had not escaped cynicism. She
now felt that she could turn her back squarely on the
past, that she was not a woman whose mistakes and
dark experiences would corrode the brain and spirit,
ruining present and future. She could not make the
same mistake again; and it was better to have made it
in early youth when the etchery of experience eats the
copper of the ego more lightly. The future seemed to
her to be full of infinite possibilities. She could be her
own fastidious dreaming idealising self again. New
friends dotted the dusk like stars. She felt ten years
away from the man to whom she had nodded a careless
good-bye that morning. A vague pleasurable loneliness
assailed her, the instinct of plurality. Then she
laughed suddenly and went to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, at eight o’clock, after a cup of
black coffee to stiffen her nerves, she presented herself
in the evening room of the “Day.” Two men and a
woman were writing at little tables. Mr. Steele in his
shirt sleeves was at his desk, reading copy. She sat
down, priding herself that her face was as impassive as
his own. In a few moments he called her to his
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have read in the newspapers, I suppose, of this
crusade of Dr. Broadhead, the fashionable Presbyterian
clergyman, against the voting of Immigrants?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is doing his best to get the women of
New York to help him, and is holding his first meeting
this morning in Cooper Union—eleven-thirty.
One of our best men will go to report the addresses,
but I want you to go and sit in the audience, and observe
how many fashionable women are there, what
they wear, and what degree of interest they appear to
take in the proceedings. Above all, I want you to
keep your eyes and ears open for any significant fact
which may or may not appear. It usually does. That
is all.—Well, what do you want?” This to the office
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience went slowly downstairs, feeling as if she
had been sent out to discover the North Pole with a
chart and a row-boat. When she reached Cooper
Union, two hours later, and found herself for the moment
an integer of one of the many phases of current
history, she forgot the agonising travail of the “news
sense,” and became so deeply interested that she
observed the many familiar faces abstractedly, and,
later, “faked” their costumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hurried to her room before the meeting was over
and wrote her “story.” It concluded thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Some four hundred women were present, at half-past
eleven in the morning; the hour indicating that
they were women of leisure, which in its turn presupposes
the large measure of education and refinement,
and a general superiority over the toiling millions.
They were very enthusiastic. When Dr. Broadhead entered
the applause was deafening. They interrupted
him every few minutes. When he sat down, and Mr.
Lionel Chambers came forward he, too, was warmly
welcomed, for his popularity is well established. He
smiled, and began something like this:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Ladies: Dr. Broadhead has left me little to say.
I being somewhat versed in politics, however, in other
words, in hard fighting with the enemy, he believes
that I may be able to give you a little useful advice.’
(Applause and cries of ‘Yes! Yes!’) ‘Now, ladies,
there are several points upon which I must ask your
attention.’ (No man ever had more serious attention.)
‘I will check them off in detail. First of all,
ladies, my advice to you is to—’ (every ear went forward)—‘is—to—pray.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He paused. There was an intense and disgusted
silence, with the exception of one or two muttered exclamations
of impatience. <span class='it'>There were just four hundred
women in the city of New York who were beyond
that sort of thing.</span> He saw his mistake at once, blundered
on confusedly, recovered himself, and gave them
much sound, practical advice which they received with
every mark of gratitude.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She hastened down to the office, her eyes shining with
the proud delight of authorship. Steele looked busier
than any one she had ever seen, but he asked sharply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see it. Skip the descriptive part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She handed him the latter part of her story, and he
ran his eye hastily over it. A gleam shot from his eyes,
but he compressed his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not bad—but I don’t know that I dare
print it. The religious hypocrisy of this country beats
that of England, strange as it may appear. However,
I’ll think it over. Come down to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The article was printed, and the result was a shower
of protesting letters from clergymen and religious
women. Patience was sent to interview a number of
representative women, of various spheres of life, on the
subject, and found herself fairly launched. She hardly
had time to realise whether she liked the work or not,
but when she was not too tired, concluded that she
did. As this phase wore off, she developed considerable
enthusiasm, and felt her bump of curiosity enlarge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She practically forgot the past, except to wonder
occasionally that she heard nothing from the Peeles.
Upon her arrival in New York, on the morning of her
departure from Peele Manor, she had mailed a note to
Beverly, which merely announced that she had left him,
never to return. He was the sort of a man to put the
matter in the hands of a detective, but so far—and
the weeks were growing into a month—he had given
no sign of any kind. She cared little for the cause of
his silence, however; she was too thankful for the fact.
Occasionally Steele gave her a brief word of praise, and
she was more delighted than she had ever been at the
admiration of man.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sprang out of bed, full of the mere joy of
living. She felt as happy as a wild creature of the
woods, and for no reason whatever. She longed for
Rosita’s voice that she might carol, and wondered if it
were possible that she had ever thought herself the
most miserable of women. The small room would not
hold her, and she went out and took a long walk in the
sharp white air; it was Sunday, and she was not obliged
to go to the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she returned, the servant told her that a gentleman
awaited her in the parlour. She turned cold,
but went defiantly in. The visitor was Mr. Field, and
the revulsion of feeling was so great, and her exuberance
of spirits so undiminished, that she ran forward,
threw her arms about his neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so happy I must kiss some one,” she said,
“and after all you are the right person, for it is owing
to you that I am happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! well!” he said laughing, “I am delighted;
and also relieved that you did not take it into your
head to do that down at the office. I’ve just dropped
in to ask after your health and to say good-bye. How
do you stand it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am well. I never felt so well. I get tired,
but I sleep it off. I made twenty-five dollars last week,
and I celebrated the occasion by coming home in a
cab. Oh, I can tell you I feel all made over, and
Peele Manor seems prehistoric.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always did live at a galloping rate mentally.
You are doing first rate—not but what you’ll do better
a year from now. There’s pulse in your stuff. Keep
your enthusiasm as long as you can. Nothing takes its
place. Here’s something for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A messenger boy had entered with a note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Mrs. Beverly Peele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed, “it has come. This
is from Mr. Peele. Do let me read it—I can’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore the envelope open and read hastily:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Patience</span>,—On the night of the day of your
departure from Peele Manor, my son came up to us in a
distracted condition. He had also contracted the grippe.
The combination of disorders produced delirium and serious
illness. For that reason and others we have not endeavoured
to communicate with you. In fact, I only ascertained
yesterday that you were working for Mr. Field,
who I consider has further betrayed my friendship in
associating himself with you in your insubordination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course you are at liberty to act as you choose. The
laws of this country are wretchedly inadequate regarding
the authority of the husband. But one thing I insist upon:
that you call upon us and make a definite statement of
what you purpose to do. If you have repented and wish
to return to us, we will overlook this wretched mistake. If
you intend definitely to leave your husband and to follow
the disgraceful life of a reporter on a sensational newspaper,
you owe it to us to come here in person and define your
position. The family with which you have allied yourself,
my dear young woman, is not one to be dismissed with
a note of three lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I particularly request that you call at three o’clock this
afternoon.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Yours truly</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='sc'>Gardiner Peele</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience handed the note to Mr. Field, who read it
with much interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go by all means,” he said; “otherwise they will
annoy you with petty persecutions, and Beverly will
haunt the ‘Day.’ Keep up all your pluck, and remember
that this is a free country, and that they can
compel you to do nothing you do not wish to do. You
are mistress of the situation, and can call upon me for
proof that you are supporting yourself adequately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t want to go. I never want to look
at one of them again. I’d just managed to forget
them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must go. It would look cowardly if you
didn’t; and, when you come to think of it, you certainly
do owe them some sort of explanation. Poor
Peele! he must have actually suffered at being treated
in such cavalier fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I’ll go! I’ll go! But I wish I’d never
seen them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look at all pretty with that face, and
I shall run. By the way, I came to tell you that I
start for Paris to-morrow to join my wife, who has
been on the other side for some months. Otherwise
she would have called before this. Steele will take
care of you.”</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience went up to her room she slammed the
door, closed the window violently, then sat down and
beat a tattoo on the floor with her heels. Her spirits
were still high, but cyclonic. She would willingly have
smashed things, and felt no disposition to sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless she rang the bell of the house in
Eleventh Street at three o’clock. The butler bowed
solemnly, and announced that the family awaited her
in the library. Patience, piqued that they were assured
of her coming, was half inclined to turn back,
then shrugged her shoulders, walked down the hall,
and through the dining-room to the library in the
annex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon sun irradiated the cheerful room,
but Beverly, with sunken eyes and pallid face, sat huddled
by the fire. He sprang to his feet as Patience
entered, then turned away with a scowl and sank back
in his chair. His mother sat opposite. She merely
bent her head to Patience, then turned her solicitous
eyes to her son’s face. Honora came forward and
kissed her sweetly. Mr. Peele did not shake hands
with her, but offered her a chair by the long table.
Patience took it, and experienced a desire to laugh
immoderately. They had the air of a Court of Inquiry,
and appeared to regard her as a delinquent at the
bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele sat in his revolving chair, tipped a little
back. He had crossed his legs and leaned his elbows
on the arms of the chair, pressing his finger tips lightly
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he said coldly, “we are ready to hear
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing in particular to say. I gave you
fair warning, and you refused to listen, or to let me go
abroad and so avoid publicity. I therefore took the
matter in my own hands and went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ignore your duty to your husband; your
marriage vows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only one law for a woman to acknowledge,
and that is her self respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The husband that loves you is entitled to no
consideration?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when he exercises none himself. I refuse
to admit that any human being has the right to control
me unless I voluntarily submit myself to that
control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you aware that you are uttering the principles
of anarchy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the true anarchists of this world are not the
bomb throwers. When a man and woman are properly
married there is no question of authority or disobedience;
but a woman is a common harlot who lives
with a man that makes her curse the whole scheme of
creation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora lifted a screen and hid her face. Beverly
muttered inaudible remarks. Mrs. Peele lifted her eyebrows
and curled her mouth. Mr. Peele moved his
head slowly back and forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not attempt to contradict any of your remarkable
theories,” he said. “It is apparent that you
are imbued with all the pernicious thought of the time.
I am thankful that it is not my destiny to live among
the next generation of women. Will you kindly tell
me how you should have acted in this matter if you had
had children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! I have thought of that. No
woman should have a child until she has been married
three years. By that time she would know whether or
not she had made a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what shall you do if you are unable to support
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Starve. No one has a right to live that the world
has no use for, that can give the world nothing. Man’s
chief end is not bread and butter. If I can give the
world anything it will be glad to give me a living in
return. If I am a failure I’ll walk out of existence as
quietly as I altered my life. But I haven’t the slightest
doubt of my ability to take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele pressed his lips together. The old man
and the young woman regarded each other steadily, the
one with malevolence in his eye, the other with defiance
in hers. In that moment Mr. Peele hated her,
and she knew it. She had made him feel old and a
component part of the decaying order of things, while
she represented the insolent confidence of youth in the
future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women make too much fuss,” continued Patience.
“If they don’t like their life why don’t they alter it
quietly, without taking it to the lecture platform or the
polemical novel? If they don’t like the way man
governs why don’t they educate their sons differently?
They can do anything with the plastic mind. I am
sure it could be proved that most corrupt politicians
and bad husbands had weak or careless mothers. If
the men of a country are bad you can be sure the
women are worse—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly sprang to his feet, overturning his chair.
“Damn it!” he cried. “You can talk all you like,
but you are mine and I’ll have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience turned and fixed her angry eyes on his face.
“Oh, no, you will not. Your father will tell you that
I am quite free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele gave a short dry laugh. “She has the
best of it,” he said. “You cannot compel her to return
to you, and she has the air of one who has tasted of
the independence of making money—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll dog her steps. I’ll make life hell for
her—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will do nothing of the sort, sir. Much as I
disapprove of this young woman’s course, she has in me
an unwilling abettor. I shall not have my domestic
affairs made food for the newspapers and their hordes
of vulgar readers. Field would take up her cause and
hound me to my grave. You will keep quiet, and in the
course of time get a divorce of which no one will be the
wiser until you marry again. If the gossip does not
get into the papers it will not rise above a murmur. If
you add to my annoyance I shall turn you out of Peele
Manor and cut you off without a cent. You will not
pretend that you can support yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience rose. “If you have nothing more to ask I
shall go,” she said. “Beverly can bring his suit as
soon as he chooses. It will go by default.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly flung off his mother’s restraining arm and
rushed forward. “You shall not go!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t touch me!” cried Patience; but before
she could reach the door Beverly had caught her in his
arms. Excitement gave him strength. He held her
with hard muscles and kissed her many times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ugly temper she had kept under control broke
loose. She lifted her hand and struck him violently on
the mouth. Her face too was convulsed, but with
another passion. She felt as if the past month had
been annihilated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you let me go?” she gasped. “Oh, how I
hate you!” Then as he kissed her again, “I could
kill you! I could kill you!” She flung herself free,
and shaking with passion faced the scandalised
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better keep him out of the way,” she said.
“Do you know that once I nearly killed my own
mother?”</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience slept little that night. Her head ached violently.
When she presented herself at the office Steele
sent her to report a morning lecture. It was dull, and
she fell asleep. When she returned to the office Steele
happened to be alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no report,” she said. “I fell asleep. That
is all I have to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few seconds he stared at her, then turned on
his heel. In a moment he came back. “The next
time you do that,” he said, “hunt up the reporter of
some other newspaper and get points from him. First-class
reporters always stand in together. Here’s a
good story badly written that has come up from Honduras.
Take it home and revamp it, and let me have it
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are awfully good. I thought you would tell
me to go, and I certainly deserve to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly do, but we won’t discuss the matter
further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was an unhappy week for Patience, and she lost
faith in her star. A great foreign actress, whom she
was sent to interview, haughtily refused to be seen,
and the next morning capriciously sent for a reporter of
the “Eye,” the hated rival of the “Day.” She was
put on the trail of a fashionable scandal and failed to
gather any facts. She was sent to interview a strange
old woman, supposed to have a history, who lived on a
canal boat, and became so interested in the creature
that she forgot all about the “Day,” and did not
appear at Mr. Steele’s desk for three days. When she
did he looked sternly at her guilty face, although the
corners of his mouth twitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m delighted to see you have not forsaken us,” he
said sarcastically. “May I ask if the canal boat woman
quite slipped your memory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-o-o. I have been there ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” His ears visibly twitched. “That
alters the case. Did you get the story out of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience looked at him steadily for a moment, then
dropped her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to tell,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steele sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out here,” he said. He led her into a
corner of the composing-room, and they sat down on a
bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tell me,” he said peremptorily. “What have
you heard? You have news in your eye. I see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose you tell the truth. You have the story,
and you won’t give it up. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—you see—she confided in me—she said I
was the only woman who had given her a decent word
in twenty years; and if I told the story she would be
in jail to-morrow night. Do you think I’d be so low
as to tell it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sentimentality, my dear young woman, is fatal to a
newspaper reporter. Suppose the entire staff should go
silly; where would the ‘Day’ be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might possibly be a good deal more admirable
than it is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t go into a discussion of theory <span class='it'>v.</span> practice.
I want that story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed.” He looked at her with cold angry eyes.
“The trouble is that you have not been made to feel
what the discipline of a newspaper office is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience leaned forward and smiled up audaciously
into his face. “You would do exactly the same thing
yourself,” she said; “so don’t scold any more. I
admit that you frighten me half to death, but all the
same I know that you would never send a poor old
woman to prison—not to be made editor-in-chief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reddened, and looked anything but pleased at
the compliment. “Do you know that you have just
said that I am a jay newspaper man?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patience only continued to smile, and in a moment
he smiled back at her, then, with an impatient
exclamation, left her and returned to his desk.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Two months later Steele asked her to come to the office
at six o’clock, an hour at which the evening room was
empty, and suggested that she should give up reporting,
and start a column of paragraphs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like it better, of course,” said Patience,
after he had fully explained the requirements of the
new department. “I was going to tell you that I <span class='it'>would
not</span> go to that Morgue again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you wouldn’t? Well, you stood it rather
longer than I thought you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m tired of interviewing insolent conceited
people. Oh, by the way, I should thank you for all
these nice things you’ve just said to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his business-like manner suddenly.
“How do you stand it?” he asked. Then in reply to
her look of surprise: “Oh, you know, the Chief, when
he went away, told me to look out for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience immediately became the charming woman
accustomed to the homage of man. Steele’s pre-eminence
was gone from that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am remarkably well, thank you, considering how
you have bullied me—and I can tell you that I
did not fancy at all being ordered about by such an
infant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Thanks! But when a man’s too polite he
doesn’t get anything done for him—not in this business.
And is it a crime to be an editor before you
are thirty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you have reason to be proud of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that I have the big head. Well, that
is the disease of the age, you know. It would never
do for a newspaper man to get a reputation for eccentricity.
You’ll have it yourself inside of six months if
these paragraphs are a success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! I scorn to be so unoriginal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll encourage your sentiments, and keep
you as the office curio; but I didn’t really bully you,
did I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll admit that you were kinder than I deserved,
once in a while: when I fell asleep at the lecture, for
instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed heartily. “That was the richest joke.
There was absolutely nothing to say to you. If you only
stood at the end of a long perspective of this business
and could fully appreciate the humour of that situation!
An experienced reporter, if he couldn’t have lied out
of it, or borrowed news, would never have shown up.
You looked like a naughty child expecting to have its
ears boxed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Miss Merrien guyed me for a whole week;
I know all about that now. And now that you’ve
come down off your pedestal I’ll thank you for all your
patience and good training. If I’ve learned to write I
owe it to your blue pencil; and I don’t need to be
told by Miss Merrien that you’ve saved me from a great
deal of hard work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled charmingly. There were times when he
looked like an old man with the mask of youth; to-day
he looked a mere boy. “Oh, any one would do as
much for you, even if the Chief hadn’t given orders.
You are an unusual woman, you know. You proved
that—but, of course, I have no right to speak to you
of that.” He stood up suddenly and held out his hand.
“Well, be good to yourself,” he said. “If you feel
yourself breaking, take a rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” she thought, as she went downstairs,
“if that young man knows he betrayed the fact that he
has been thinking a good deal about me? He certainly
is an interesting youth, and I should like to know him
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience did not find her paragraphs as easy as
she expected. It was one thing to work on a given
idea, and another to supply idea and execution both;
but after a time her sharpened brain grew more
magnetic and life fuller of ideas than of lay figures.
The men in the office frequently gave her tips, and one
clever young reporter, who worshipped her from afar,
fell into the daily habit of presenting her with a slip of
suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her choicest paragraphs were usually edited by
Steele’s ruthless hand, and now and again she was
moved to wrath. Upon such occasions Mr. Steele
merely smiled, and she was forced to smile in return or
retire with the sulks.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was writing busily in her little bedroom. The
March winds were howling down the street. Her door
opened, and a very elegant young woman entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal!” cried Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear bad girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kissed a half dozen times, then sat down and
looked at each other. Hal had quite the young married
woman air, and held herself with a mien of conscious
importance, entirely removed from conceit: she
was <span class='it'>grande dame</span>, and the late object of attentions from
smart folks abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how are you?” asked Patience. “Oh, but I
am glad to see you. Tell me all about yourself. When
did you get back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Day before yesterday. I’ve returned with thirty-two
trunks, the loveliest jewels you ever saw, and quite
a slave of a husband. I must say I never thought
Latimer would keep up such a prolonged bluff, but he
fills the rôle as if he’d been husbanding all his life.
Oh, no. Don’t look at me like that. I’ve forgotten
it, and I’ve no regrets. <span class='it'>Mon Dieu!</span> To think that I
might be in Boston on four hundred a month! I shall
be a leader, my dear. You can do as much with a
hundred and fifty thousand a year as you can with a
million, for you can only spend just so much money anyhow.
All that the big millionaires get out of their
wealth is notoriety. Nobody’d remember about them
if it wasn’t for the newspapers. But you bad bad girl!
What have you been and gone and done? Why didn’t
you wait for me? I would have rescued you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you couldn’t, Hal dear. I didn’t want to be
rescued for a day or a month. I’ve run away for good
and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patience, what an alternative! Do you mean
to say you live in this cubby-hole?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m mighty happy in this cubby-hole, I can tell
you; happier than I ever was at Peele Manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That certainly was the mistake of my life. However,
you’ve solved the problem more promptly than
most women do. The celerity with which you untied
that knot when you set about it moved me to admiration.
By the way, do you know that Bev is ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he? What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know exactly,—one of those organic afflictions
that men are always getting. How uninteresting
men are when their interior decorations get out of gear.
And they always will talk about them. Latimer is ever
groaning with his liver; but no wonder. I’ve had to
eat so much rich stuff to keep him from feeling lonesome
that I’ve actually grown fat. Well, we don’t
know what is the matter with Bev, yet. The doctor
says it’s a result of the influenza. He has some pain,
and makes an awful fuss, like all men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going to stay, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am at the Holland, but will spend the summer at
the Manor and the fall at Newport. Our house on the
Avenue—opposite the park, you know—will be finished
by winter. That house will be a jewel. I got the
most beautiful things abroad for it. Then you will
come and live with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t do, and you will see it. I belong to
another sphere now; but I can see you sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, put up that stuff, and come to the Holland
and dine with me. You can finish up to-night. I have
yards and yards to talk to you about. I’ll never give
you up,—remember that.”</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When the hot days and nights of summer came
Patience did not find routine and the hunt as fascinating
sport as when the electric thrill of cooler seasons
was in the air. Her paragraphs acquired some reputation,
and her mind grew tense in the effort to keep
them up to a high standard, and to prepare at least
one surprise a day. She grew thin and nervous, and
began to wonder what life and herself would be like
five years hence. Mr. Field and Steele helped her as
much as they dared, and she managed to make about
fifty dollars a week: her success gave Mr. Field the
excuse to pay her special rates. It never occurred to
her to give up, and she assured Hal that she would
have nervous prostration four times a year before she
would return to Peele Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times when she passionately longed for
the isolation of a mountain top. Nature had been
part of her very individuality for all the years of her
life until this last, and a forested mountain top alone
was the antithesis of Park Row. She sometimes had
a whimsical idea that her grey matter was becoming
slowly modelled into a semblance of that famous precinct.
She loved it loyally; but the isolation of high
altitudes sent their magnetism to another side of her
nature. She was getting farther and farther away from
herself in the jealous absorption of her work,—the
skurrying practical details of her life. She felt that she
could no longer forecast what she should do under
given circumstances, that something in her was slowly
changing. What the result would be she could not
predict; and she craved solitude and the opportunity
to study herself out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In August Mrs. Field took her to her house in the
Berkshire hills. Although she had no solitude there, she
returned much refreshed, and did good work all winter.
Steele she never saw outside of the office, but he managed
to treat her with a certain knightliness, and she lay
awake, occasionally, thinking about him. Hard work
and the practical side of life had disposed of a good
deal of her romance, but she was still given to vagaries.
Steele’s modernity fascinated her. No other epoch but
this extraordinary last quarter of the nineteenth century
could have produced him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a great favourite in the office. Again a
thaw had succeeded a second glacier period, induced
by entire change of environment, and she liked nearly
everybody she knew, and became a most genial and
expansive young woman. She often laughed at herself,
and concluded that she would never strike the proper
balance until she fell in love (if she ever did), when
the large and restless currents of her nature would unite
and find their proper destination. She had no “weird
experiences.” Her abounding feminity appealed to
the chivalry of the gentlemen among whom she was
thrown, and she was clever enough not to flirt with
them, to treat them impartially as good comrades.
The second-class men detested her, and were not conciliated:
the underbred newspaper man touches a lower
notch of vulgarity than any person of similar social
degree the world over.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>One morning she awoke about four o’clock,—that
is, her mind awoke; her body was still too full of sleep
to move to the right or left. It was one of her favourite
sensations, and she lay for a time meditating upon the
various pleasures, great and small, which are part of
man’s inheritance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she became conscious that it was raining.
She had moved into a back room on the second floor.
Beside one window was a tin roof upon which the rain
poured with heavy reiterance. In the back yard was
a large ailanthus tree which lifted itself past her windows
to the floor above. A light wind rustled it.
The rain pattered monotonously upon its wide leaves,
producing a certain sweet volume of sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long since she had listened to rain in the
night. It was associated in her mind with the vague
sweet dreams of girlhood and with her life in Carmel
Valley. She had loved to wander through the pine
woods when the winter rains were beating through the
uplifted arms, swirling and splashing in the dark fragrant
depths. It said something to her then, she hardly knew
what, nor when it roared upon the roof of the old farmhouse,
or flung itself through the windows of Carmel
tower, as she and Solomon huddled close to the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when it had beaten upon the roof of her little
room in Miss Tremont’s house it had sung the loneliness
of youth into her soul, murmured of the great
joy to which every woman looks forward as her birthright.
Hard worked and absorbed as she may have
been during the day, if the rain awoke her in the night,
it was to dreams of love and of nothing else, and of the
time when she should no longer be alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning she listened to the rain for a time, then
moved suddenly to her side, her eyes opening more
widely in the dark. The rain said nothing to her. She
listened to it without a thrill, with no longing, with no
loneliness of soul, and no vague tremor of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing in her unhappy experience had so forcibly
brought home to her the changes which her inner self
had undergone in the last few years. Life was a hard
clear-cut fact; she could no longer dream. Imagination
had taken itself out of her and gone elsewhere,
into some brain whose dear privilege it was to have a
long future and a brief past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears scalded her eyes. She cursed Beverly
Peele. She wished she had remained in Monterey.
There, at least, she would never have married any one,
for there was no one to marry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if my life had been a success,” she thought,
“if Beverly Peele had been less objectionable, or had
died, and I had had the world at my feet, it would be too
high a price to pay. Not even to care that one is alone
when the rain is sweeping about with that hollow song!
To think and dream of nothing beyond the moment!
To have accepted life with cynical philosophy, and feel
no desire to shake the Universe with a great passion!
To be beyond the spell of the rain is to be a thousand
years old, and a thousand centuries away from the
cosmic sense. I wish I were dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there were other moods. Sometimes the devil
which is an integral part of all strong natures—of
woman’s as well as of man’s, and no matter what her
creed—awoke and clamoured. There were four or
five men in the office whom she liked well enough
when absent, and in whom the lightning of her glance
would have changed friendship to passion. Why she
resisted the temptation which so fiercely assailed her
at times she never knew. Conventions did not exist
for her impatient mind excepting in so far as they
made life more comfortable; she had in full measure
youth’s power to know and to give joy, and she owed
no one loyalty. And at this time she imaged no future:
she had lost faith in ideals. It was only at brief
intervals that there came a sudden passionate desire—almost
a flash of prophetic insight—for the one man
who must exist for her among the millions of men.
And this, if anything, took the place of her lost ideals
and conquered the primal impulses of her nature. Or
was it a mere matter of destiny? Woman is a strange
and complex instrument. She is as she was made,
and it is not well to condemn her even after elaborate
analysis.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One morning in May, Hal came in before Patience was
out of bed. She sat down on a chair and tapped the
floor with her foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come charged with a message, a special mission,
as it were,” she said. “I hardly know where to begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look at me like that, or I’ll never have the
courage to go on. Bev is desperately ill,—not in bed,
but he has the most frightful pains: his disease, which
has been threatening for a year, has developed. It
may or may not be fatal. The doctor says it certainly
will be unless he has peace of mind, and he is fretting
after you like a big baby. The grippe seems to have
broken the back of his temper, and he is simply a
great calf bleating for its parent. It would be ridiculous
if it were not serious. You’d better come back
to us, Patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would say exactly that; but when you
think it over you will come. Remember that the doctor
practically says that you can either save or prolong
his life. Mamma is simply distracted. You know she
adores Bev, and she broke down completely last night
and told me to come and beg you to return. You
know what that means: you’ll have nothing to fear
from her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t go back! I can’t! I think I should
die if I went back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t die so easily, my dear. Now, I’ll go
and let you think it over,” and the <a id='dip'></a>diplomat kissed
Patience and retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience endeavoured to put the matter out of her
mind, but it harassed her through her day’s duties,
and her work was bad. Steele told her as much the
next afternoon when she came into the office late, intending
to write there instead of at home. Her room
was haunted by Beverly’s pallid face and sunken eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” she said, flinging herself down before a
table, “perhaps it’s the last, so it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? What do you mean? You do look pale.
Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience hesitated a moment, then told him of the
complication. He listened, without comment, looking
down upon the skurrying throngs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I must go,” she said in conclusion.
“Anyway I feel that I shall go, whether I want to or
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came over to the table and regarded her with his
preternatural seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “you will go. It will be like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am no angel. It’s not that—please! It’s—don’t
you know there are some good acts you can’t
help? Not only do traditions and conventions drive
you into them, but your own selfishness—I haven’t
the courage to be lashed by my conscience. If I could
give that morphine, do you think I’d go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “Do you analyse everything like that?
However, I choose to keep to my illusions. I think
that you have magnificent theories, but act very much
like other people. Can I go up and see you sometimes?
I may have a chance to know you, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put up her hand and took his impulsively. “Yes,
come,” she said. “That is the only thing that will
make life supportable.”</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>She went home and wrote the following letter to
Beverly Peele:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“I will return to Peele Manor and remain while you are
seriously ill, under the following conditions: (1) That you
pay me what you would be obliged to pay a trained nurse;
(2) That you will treat me on that basis absolutely. My
feeling toward you has undergone no change. I am not
your wife. But as your physician holds me responsible for
your life, I will be your nurse on the terms stated above.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day she received this telegram:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Come. Terms agreed to.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'><span class='sc'>Beverly Peele.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She was received by the various members of the
household with infinite tact. Mrs. Peele’s cold blue
eyes sheltered an angry spark, but she behaved to her
errant daughter-in-law exactly as if matrimonial vacations
were orthodox and inevitable. Honora kissed
her sweetly, and asked her if the roses were not beautiful.
When Mr. Peele came home he said, “Ah, good-evening.”
Beverly, who had evidently been coached,
did not offer to kiss her, but immediately explained
every detail of his disease. Hal and her husband were
in the North Carolina mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beverly was not a good actor, and his eyes followed
his wife with kaleidoscopic expression. She frequently
encountered hungry admiration and angry resentment;
and if he had made up his mind to abide by her decree
he as clearly evidenced that he considered her his
salaried property: he demanded her constant attendance.
He looked so wan and hopeless that Patience
was moved to pity, and even to tenderness, and devoted
herself to his care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first two weeks she felt hourly as if she must
pack her trunk and flit back to the “Day.” She longed
for a very glimpse of the grimy men in the composing-room,
and felt that the sight of Morgan Steele in his
shirt sleeves would give more spiritual satisfaction than
the green and grey of the Palisades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The life at Peele Manor seemed doubly flat after her
emancipation. At the breakfast table, Mrs. Peele and
Honora discussed their small interests. At luncheon,
Beverly—who arose late—gave the details of his
night. At dinner there was little conversation of any
sort. The mornings, and the afternoons from four
to six—when Beverly drove with his mother and
Honora—were Patience’s own. Although discontented,
she was by no means unhappy: she was out
of bondage forever. If Beverly grew better she could
return to the “Day” after a reasonable time had
elapsed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spent most of her leisure rambling over the hills
in idle reverie or meditating upon her checkered life.
She gave a good deal of thought to the many phases of
life which had flashed before her startled eyes in the
last year, but was too young not to be more interested
in herself than in problems, however momentous. Still,
she did not feel much more intimate with herself than
she had felt in Park Row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frequently wondered with some pique and much
disapproval that she heard nothing from Morgan Steele.
The few glimpses she had caught of the nature behind
the mask tempted her to idealise him, and she finally
succumbed. One night she awoke to the fact that she
had been walking the stars with him, discussing the
mysteries of the Universe. She pictured the smile with
which he would regard the workings of her imagination,
were they revealed to him, and recalled his business-like
demeanour, his shirt sleeves, his Park Row vocabulary,
and his impatient scorn of “damned slush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened to be midnight when these later thoughts
arrived, and she laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you laughing at?” demanded a querulous
voice from the next room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing? Do you suppose I’m an idiot? Tell
me what you were laughing at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to sleep, go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go to sleep. You lie there and laugh while
I lie here and suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you say you were suffering? Do you
want the morphine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Patience was roused from her first
heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience! Patience! Oh, my God! My God!
My God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stumbled out of bed and into her dressing-gown
and slippers, shaking her head vigorously to dispel
the vapours in her brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!” she said. “I’m coming. Do please
don’t make such a fuss. You’ll wake up everybody—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not make a fuss! Oh, I wish you had it for a
minute—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience ran into the lavatory and turned up the gas.
The night was very warm, and the door leading into
Honora’s room stood wide. The light fell full on her
face. Patience saw that her eyes were open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope Beverly didn’t wake you up,” she said.
“He does make such a noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was awake. I never sleep well in warm weather.
I don’t envy you, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mind if only I don’t make a terrible
mistake some night and give him an overdose. He
takes particular pains to wait until I am in my first
sleep and then I hardly know what I am doing. There!
this is the third time I have dropped the wretched stuff.
What is the good of drop bottles, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you use the hypodermic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t. It would make me ill to puncture people.
And this does him as much good.” She set the bottle
down impatiently, drew a basin full of cold water,
dashed it over her face, then dropped the dose and
took it to Beverly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay with me,” he commanded. “You know it
doesn’t take effect at once, and I feel better if I hold
your hand.” She sat down beside him and nodded
sleepily until the morphine did its work.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next afternoon, a few moments after Beverly had
gone for his drive, Morgan Steele’s card was brought up
to Patience. She had imagined that this first call
would induce a mild thrill of nerve, but she merely
remarked to the butler: “Tell him I will be down in
a moment,” walked to the long mirror in the corner,
and shook out her violet and white organdie skirts. Her
long hair was braided and tied with a lavender ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I look very well,” she thought, and went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steele awaited her in the drawing-room, and, as she
entered, was standing with his head thrown back, regarding
the medallion of Whyte Peele. She noted
anew how well he dressed and carried his clothes.
He looked quite at home in the drawing-room of
Peele Manor. Her first remark followed in natural
sequence,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How odd not to see you in your shirt sleeves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned with a start and a sudden warmth in his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I hope you’ll never see me that way
again. How charming you look in that frock and with
your hair in that braid! <span class='it'>I</span> always imagine <span class='it'>you</span> in prim
tailor things, with your hair tucked out of sight under a
stiff turban. This is lovely. You look like a little girl.
Those awful dress reformers should see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a comfort to think that the She-males cannot
exterminate the artistic sense. Let us go into the
library.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a large comfortable chair there? These
are impressive but unpleasant. Perhaps you would not
suspect it, but I love a comfortable chair and a cigar
better than anything in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing I do suspect—that we shall have to
become acquainted all over again. You are not exactly
like a fallen angel outside of the office, but you certainly
have not patronised me for five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can take your revenge now and patronise
me. Hang the shop! I don’t want to think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the library he critically inspected every chair,
selected one that pleased him, and drawing it to the
open window sank into it with a deep sigh of content.
Patience gave him permission to smoke, and a moment
later he looked so happy that she laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may laugh,” he said plaintively, “but you
have less imagination than I thought if you don’t understand
what this is to a man after Park Row. After
an hour of that water and your muslin frock, I shall
go back as refreshed as if my brain had taken a cold
bath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d fly back to the office this minute if I could.
I’ve felt like a bottle of over-charged champagne for
two weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the enthusiasm of youth. When you are
my age—sixty-five—you will be thankful for the <span class='it'>dolce
far niente</span> of a colonial manor. This sort of life suits
you—you are a born châtelaine. You have lost your
tired expression, and are actually stouter. Besides, I
want to come up here to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come often?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As often as you will let me. I am free every
afternoon, you know, and if I followed my tactless inclination
I’d come seven times a week. However,
don’t look alarmed; I’m only coming once a week—”
He sat up suddenly, his eyes sparkling. “By Jove!”
he exclaimed. “What a beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience followed his eyes, which were directed
ardently upon a sail-boat skimming up the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of sailing?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I? I could live in a boat. I’d rather be in
a boat than—than even talking to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you shall be inside of a boat in five minutes,”
she said good-naturedly. “Wait until I get my hat and
gloves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Being only the nurse,” she said, as they walked
down the wooded slope to the boathouse, “I don’t
know that I have any right to take liberties, but I will,
all the same. I feel that it is an act of charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly is, and you really are an angel.—She’s
a good boat,” he said approvingly, a few moments
later, as he unreefed the sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience arranged the cushions and made herself
comfortable, and they shot up the river in a stiff breeze.
She watched Steele curiously. He looked as happy as
a schoolboy. His hat was on the back of his head, his
eyes shone. Once as he threw back his head and
laughed, he bore an extraordinary resemblance to the
Laughing Faun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve lived in a boat for a whole summer,” he said,
“and never seen a woman nor wanted to, nor a man
neither, for that matter. There are three months in
the year when I want nothing better in life than this.”
His large cool eyes moved slowly to hers. “Still,” he
added, “I do believe it’s an improvement to have you
here. What fun if we had a little yacht and could sail
like this all summer! I think we’d hit it off, don’t
you? We shouldn’t either of us talk too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience laughed. It was impossible to coquet with
Steele. He took no notice of it. “I should be afraid
you’d tip me over if you got tired of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t get tired of you,” he said seriously.
“I never met a woman I liked half as much. You’re
lovely to look at, and your mind is so interesting to
study. Guess I’d better come about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sailed for two hours. The wind fell, and they
talked in a desultory fashion. They discovered that
they had the same literary gods, and occasionally
Steele waxed enthusiastic. He had read more than
most men of forty; nor was there anything youthful
about the fixity of his opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” said Patience, suddenly, “why did
we never meet before? I like you better than any one
I ever knew. I’ve been hunting all my life for a
mental companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I,” he said, smiling at her in his half cynical
way, “and now I’ve found you I don’t propose to
let you go; not even next winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He confided to her that he had written a good deal,
although he had published nothing. Patience wondered
where he had found time to accomplish so
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to bring up some of my stuff and read
it to you,” he said. “You can take that as a compliment
if you like, for I’ve only shown it to one other
person—a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I know why you like me! You are going to
study me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s partly that,” he replied coolly. “You are
a new type—to me at any rate, and I shall probably
know a good deal more after I have known you a year
or so than I do now. Who is that? What an amiable-looking
person!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience followed his glance. Beverly stood at the
foot of the slope, with distorted face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear,” she said, “that is Mr. Peele. I am
afraid he is going to be disagreeable. Of course I am
not obliged to stay—but in a way I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steele ran the boat into the dock, handed her out,
and reefed the sail before he spoke. Then he turned
and looked at her squarely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you rather I did not come?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! I want you to come. I’ll think it
over and write you—or—I wonder if you are horrid
like most men and would misunderstand me if I asked
you always to come on a certain day and meet me in
that wood up there, instead of going to the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said in his old business-like tone,
“just let me set your mind at rest. I haven’t the
slightest intention of making love to you. In the first
place I am just now tired and sick of that sort of thing—a
state a man does get into occasionally, although
a woman will never believe it. In the second place I
like to think of you as <span class='it'>sui generis</span>; a woman on a
pedestal. It is very refreshing. A week from to-day
I’ll be in that wood, and I’ll stay there from four to
six whether you come or not. There comes my
train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must flag it. Hurry. I’ll expect you Thursday.”</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that man?” thundered Beverly, as she crossed
the track behind the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience raised her eyebrows. “What have you to
do with my visitors?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sha’n’t receive men, and you sha’n’t sail in
my boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course the boat is yours. I shall not use it
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are my nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your nurse is always ready to be dismissed,” and
she walked up the slope, taking no further notice of
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hal returned the following week; and, as Beverly
improved steadily, the house was filled with company
once more. Whenever Patience hinted that she was
no longer required, Beverly immediately went to bed
and rent the air; but as a matter of fact his attacks
were growing less and less frequent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, in the circumstances, was not impatient to
return to work until the hot weather was over. Her
position was very pleasant, Hal was ever her loyal
friend, and she saw Morgan Steele once a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wood was a wild place on a slope of the bluff
some distance above the house. Its underbrush made
it unpopular with the guests of Peele Manor. Steele
left the train at the regular station a mile up the road
and walked back without encounter. In the heart of
the dark cool little wood Patience swung two hammocks
and filled them with pillows. Steele lay full
length in his and looked comfortable and happy, a cigar
ever between his lips. Patience, in hers, sat in as
dignified an attitude as she could assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it make you feel romantic?” he said one
day, looking at her quizzically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked, flushing a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I think you have a queer romantic sentimental
streak through your modernity—or had. I’ve been
wondering if there was any of it left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but you suggest it. Tell me: didn’t you once
have ideals and that sort of thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you can even guess it, for I have
none now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you have. You won’t when you’re thirty,
but you have all sorts of kiddish notions stored away yet
in that brain of yours.” He had seen Peele a few days
before in the train, and knew the history of their courtship
quite as well as if she had related it to him, but
he was curious to know what she had been before. He
drew her on until she told him the story of the tower
and the owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That little picture pleased his artistic sense, but when
she described her girlish ideals and dreams he threw
back his head and laughed loud and long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would I have done with you if I had met
you then?” he said, looking with intense amusement at
her half angry face. “I should have run, I expect.
You are a thousand times more interesting now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, because you are less of an egoist,
and draw a larger measure of your individuality from
your environment. But you are real now, where before
you were unreal—you were a sort of waxwork with
numerous dents. The two extremes in this world are
nature and civilisation. Children belong by right to
nature, and she holds on to them as long as possible.
When civilisation gets hold of them she proceeds to
pick out with a pair of tweezers all but the primal
passions; and the result is the only human variety
capable of enjoying life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you believe in ideals?” asked Patience,
rather wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” he said contemptuously. “Life is
what it is, and you can’t alter it. And as we are only
just so big and have only just so many years in which
to get over a limited surface of this mighty complication
called Life, all we can do is to keep our eyes open,
and pick out here and there what appeals to our taste
most strongly, swallowing the disagreeable majority as
philosophically as possible. When you know the world—and
yourself—you can’t have ideals, and the sooner
you quit wasting time thinking about them the sooner
you begin to enjoy life. And remember that we live
but from day to day—we may be a cold cadaver to-morrow.
Life is a game of chance. To set up ideals
is as purposeless as to waste this life preparing for an
impossible next. Omar expressed it better than I can
when he said:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“‘To-morrow? Why, to-morrow I myself may be</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With yesterday’s seven thousand years.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You have certain ideals though,” said Patience.
“You are intellectually ambitious; and you say that
you never run after a merely pretty face, and never
wasted time on any sort of woman unless she had
brains; and the men at the office say that you are
scrupulously square in money matters. So that I can’t
see that you are altogether without ideals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are mere matters of taste and worldly sense.
I aim for nothing that is impossible. When I think I
want a thing I set about to accomplish it. If I find
that it is impossible I quit without further loss of time.
You don’t suppose I have an ideal woman, do you?
How can any man that knows women?—although he
may often succumb to a happy combination. When I
was exactly twelve my Sunday School teacher forestalled
any inclination I might have developed to idealise
woman. I met her once after I was grown, by the
way, and it did me good to tell her what I thought of
her. That is where you women have the advantage
of us. It is so long before you know man at all that
after you do it is hard work making him over as he
is. The woman never lived that understood man by
intuition. That is the reason a woman so seldom has
any fascination but that of mere youth until she’s
pretty well on to thirty. You, of course, have had
an exceptional experience, but you are a good deal of
a kid yet.”</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Morgan Steele was a type of the precocious young
United States newspaper man which only this end of the
century has evolved: Preternaturally wise in the way of
the world and the nature of woman; with young blood
and cold judgment; wary, deliberate, calculating; full
of kind impulses; generous with his money, yet careful
of it; ready to make cold-blooded use of a man to-day
and offer him a free lodging to-morrow; possessed of
more self-control than the Club man of forty; without
sentimentality, yet with a certain limited power of
loving; having a thorough appreciation of the finer
as of the coarser shades of woman; incapable of a
blind supreme rush of feeling, through the habit of
eternal analysis; placidly and philosophically content
with the present, and fully expecting to be laid away in
the past at forty; <span class='it'>blasé</span>, yet full of boyish delight in
outdoor sport; having faith in no woman, yet treating
the lowest with a cynical kindness and consideration
which was part of his philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night he faced the question of his relationship
to Patience with his usual deliberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay on a divan in his bachelor quarters: a long
room with bedroom and bath attached. The walls
of the living-room were covered with red paper, the
doors and windows hung with Smyrna cloth. A rug
half covered the stained floor. Between the windows
was a large desk covered with papers. A long table
was strewn thick with magazines. Small bookcases
were filled with the works of Omar, Whitman, Emerson,
Hugo, Heine, Dumas, Maupassant, Bourget, Pater, Dobson,
Herrick, Ibsen, Zola, Landor, Rabelais, Stevenson,
Kipling. On the mantel there was a number of photographs
and a notable absence of legs. The walls were
covered with artists’ sketches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The summer will pass harmlessly enough,” he
thought. “I only see her once a week, and her husband
is likely to be hidden in the brush; but when she
returns to town in the winter I shall find myself calling
on her every night. I’m not stuck on matrimony, but
I certainly should like her for a companion in a little
house or double apartment where there would be
plenty of elbow room and some chance of keeping up
the illusions. I think it would be some years before I
should tire of her, and I think I could love her a good
deal. Why in thunder doesn’t the man die? She’s
too good for anything else. It would be a terrible pity—the
details smirch so. A novelist would remark at
this point, ‘And yet he never thought of sparing her.’
No, my dear fictionist, we don’t, nor if she loved me
would she thank me for sparing her. And yet it
would be a pity. She is like some delicate wild-flower
that has been transplanted. I should like to offer her
the best one can, instead of practically remarking:
‘My dear, this brain racket is worked out for the
present. We’ll return to it later, or not at all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is often a clever thing for those that love and
cannot marry to part when the shock comes: they
coddle the misery and have a glorious time suffering.
But that would not do for us. We live in the thick
and rush of life, and have no time to sit down with
memories, hardly time enough to realise an ache. We
must have our day in fact or not at all; and afterward,
thank God, there is again no time for memories. Well,
this is only the eighth of July. By winter that intolerable
nuisance may be in the family vault.”</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>People remarked that summer that Patience looked
unusually well. At times her eyes had a certain liquid
softness, at others they sparkled wickedly. Her colour
was beautiful and her manner and conversation full of
animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on a hot August afternoon that Patience and
Steele, in the green shades of their wood, suddenly met
each other’s eyes and burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are in love,” said Patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—yes—I suppose we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel very light-minded over this unexpected
<span class='it'>dénouement</span>. I had imagined all sorts of dramatic
climaxes; but the unexpected always will happen in
this life—more’s the pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you expect we should not fall in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not think about it at all for a time—just
drifted. But as the situation is so serious it is as well
to take it humourously. What are we going to do about
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had removed his cigar, and was regarding her with
his contemplative stare. “I have thanked your complicated
ancestors more than once for your large variety
of moods. I am glad and sorry that you have spoken:
sorry, because this was very pleasant; glad that the
discussion of ways and means should take place here
instead of in town. I shall be brutally frank. How
long is your husband likely to live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may live for twenty years. I heard the doctors—they
have a consultation every once in a while—tell
Mrs. Peele so the other day. He is much better. On
the other hand, he might take a turn for the worse any
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must persuade him to give you a
divorce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, I am afraid that is out of the question.
I’ve thought of it; but—you don’t know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a clever woman: now look up your
resources. Enlist the family on your side. Tell them
that you are about to leave, never to return, and that
you are on the road to become a famous newspaper
woman; that if they will persuade your husband to give
you a divorce you will drop their name; otherwise that
it will be dinned in their ears for the next twenty years.
Tell them that we intend to let you sign hereafter.
That ought to fetch them, as they appear to look upon
the newspaper business with shuddering horror. And
persuade them that Beverly needs a good domestic little
wife who would gladden his declining years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I feel in this mood,” said Patience,
abruptly. “I should far rather it had been the other
way—the usual way. I suppose I am possessed with
what Poe calls The Imp of the Perverse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear girl, I need not remind you that it is just
as well and a good deal better. You need a shaking to
wake you up, though. You imagine that you are awake
already, but you are not—not by a long sight. You
have buried your nature five fathoms deep. Well, time
is up. I must be off. Think over what I have said.
Good-bye.”</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the following Thursday morning Patience walked
slowly over to where Beverly sat under a tree on one of
the lawns, reading a newspaper. She had made up her
mind to adopt Steele’s advice, but had deferred the
evil moment as long as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beverly,” she said abruptly, sitting down in front of
him, “I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid down the newspaper and regarded her with
eager admiration. She had carefully selected the most
unbecoming frock she possessed, a sickly green, and
twisted her hair in a fashion to distort the fine lines of
her head. Nevertheless, she looked as fresh as the
morning, and her eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he asked. “Oh, why—why—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind! I am going to have a business talk
with you, and please don’t get excited. If you do,
you’ll be sure to have a pain, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it? It doesn’t do a fellow any good
to keep him in suspense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the first of November I am going away—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall not come back—not in any circumstances.
You have proved that your attacks are more
or less under your own control. A sojourn at some
foreign baths will probably cure you. I have given you
all of my life that I intend to give you. I know that
self-sacrifice is the ideal of happiness of some women,
but it is not mine. When I leave here on the first of
November it will be forever. There is no inducement,
material nor sentimental, that will bring me back.
Do you understand that much clearly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He burst into a volley of oaths, and beat his knees
with his fists. Patience continued as soon as she could
be heard:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, it can do you no possible good to retain a
legal hold on me, nor can you care to hear of your
name becoming familiar in Park Row. Give me my
freedom, and I will take my own name—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get no divorce,” he roared, “now nor ever.
Do you understand that? I’ll brace up and live until
I’m ninety—by God I will! I’ll go abroad and live at
a water cure. You’ll never be the wife of any other
man. Do you understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Beverly,” she said, breaking suddenly, “don’t
be cruel,—don’t! What good can it do you? Give me
my freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grasped her wrists. His eyes were full of rage
and malevolence. “Do you want to marry some one
else?” he asked. “Some damned newspaper man, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience stood up and shook him off. “If ever I
do marry another man,” she said cuttingly, “you may
be sure he will have brains this time, and that he will
also be a gentleman. The most vulgar persons I
have ever known have been socially the most highly
placed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she moved away he sprang after her and caught
her arm. “Now look here,” he said hoarsely, “you’ll
neither marry, nor will you have a lover, unless you
want all New York to know it. The moment you leave
this place a detective goes after you. You’ll do nothing
that I don’t know. I may not have brains, but I’ll get
the best of you all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience flung him off and went straight to Mrs.
Peele. Her mother-in-law watched her with narrowed
eyes until she had finished, then remarked unexpectedly:
“I shall do my best to make my son
divorce you. If you intend to leave us I prefer that the
rupture should be complete. As you suggest, I have no
desire to see the name of Peele signed to newspaper
articles. Moreover, I believe I can persuade my son to
marry again,—a woman of his own station, who will
not desecrate the name of wife; and who,” with sudden
violence, “will give this house an heir.” She paused
a moment to recover herself, then continued more
calmly: “I have talked the matter over with my husband,
and he agrees with me. Of course, you will
expect no alimony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want alimony. I make more with my pen
than Beverly ever allowed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red came into Mrs. Peele’s face. “My son was
quite as generous as was to be expected. Moreover, he
had the right to demand that his wife should not come
to him empty handed. I shall speak to Beverly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Patience met Mrs. Peele in the side
hall. The older woman looked flushed and excited.
“I have had a most terrible interview with Beverly,”
she exclaimed. “I can do nothing with him. You
little fool, why didn’t you swear that you did not want
to marry another man? Heaven knows I should prefer
to have you take another name as soon as possible; but
you have ruined your chances by letting Beverly suspect
the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sank upon a chair, and sat for a long while
staring straight before her. She felt the incarnation of
rage and hate. Her lovely face was set and repellent.
She came to herself with a start, and wondered if she had
ever had any womanly impulses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never wanted anything in her life as much
as she wanted to marry Morgan Steele. His very
unlikeness to all her old ideals fascinated her, and she
was convinced that she was profoundly in love. She
could hardly imagine what life with him would be like,
and was the more curious to ascertain; and the obstacles
enraged her impatient spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The butler left the dining-room to announce luncheon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send mine up to my room,” she said. As she
reached the first landing of the stair she turned to him
suddenly. “Tell John to go to New York this afternoon,
and have Mr. Beverly’s morphine bottle filled.
He took the last last night and he may need it again
before I go down myself. Don’t fail to tell him.
The bottle is in the lavatory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon she met Steele at the edge of the
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not keep still,” she said. “My brain feels
on fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew her hand through his arm and held it
tenderly. “What is it?” he asked. “Did you speak,
and was it disagreeable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you in a minute. Just now it is enough to
feel you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only stay an hour. I should not have come
at all, but I could not stay away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the hammocks Patience flung
herself into hers and told the story of the morning
with dramatic indignation. Then, insensibly, she
drifted into the story of her married life, and described
her intense hatred and loathing of her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all my own fault,” she said in conclusion.
“I married him with my eyes open; but all the same
I hate him. Sometimes I felt, and feel yet, fairly
murderous. I seem to have a terrible nature—does it
make you hate me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “No, I don’t hate you, and you know
it quite as well as I do. You have wonderful possibilities—but
I can’t quite make up my mind that I am
the man—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you are. I could love you as much as I
hate Beverly Peele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you think so it amounts to the same thing,
for a while at least. I shall come again in a few days.
I’ll write you. If your husband cannot be induced to
change his mind I’ll talk to you about a paper that
has been offered to me in Texas; but if you prefer it
the other way, I’ll leave you alone without a word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! There are some words I hate,—the
words free-love and adultery. I don’t want to
be exploited in the newspapers, and I don’t want to
be insulted by my landlord. After all, expediency is
the source of all morality. My life with you would be
a thousand times better than it was with Beverly Peele;
but I suspect that we can’t violate certain moral
laws that heredity has made part of our brain fibre,
without ultimate regret, even when we keep the world
in ignorance. I suffered horribly once, although I had
not defied the conventions. But I think we must have
everything, or the large share of herself that Nature has
given each of us rebels,—in other words, the ideal is
not complete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you are very much in love,” he said dryly,
“you won’t analyse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contrary to her habit, she remained in the wood for
some time after he left her. Suddenly she was aroused
from her reverie by a peculiar heavy sound, as of a
man crawling. She listened intently, her hair stiffening:
the house was a quarter of a mile away. The
sound continued steadily. She sprang to her feet and
fled from the wood. As she ran up the hill beyond,
she glanced fearfully over her shoulder. A man shot
from the lower edge of the wood and ran toward the
stables.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>An hour after midnight Patience ran into Honora’s
room and shook her violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honora! Honora!” she cried, “something is the
matter with Beverly. I can’t wake him up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora stretched herself languidly. Her eyelids
fluttered a moment, then lifted. She said sleepily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Patience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beverly! Go to him—quick—while I wake up
Mr. and Mrs. Peele, and send for the doctor. He
dropped his own morphine to-night, and he must have
taken too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later there was an alarmed group of
people at Beverly Peele’s bedside, and the butler could
be heard at the telephone demanding the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele was in his pyjamas, and Patience struggled
with an importunate desire to tell him that his hair
stood on end. Mrs. Peele’s back hair was in a scant
braid; the front locks were on pins. Her skin looked
pallid and old. Honora, as usual, looked like a vision
from heaven. Hal and her husband were in Newport,
and there were no guests at Peele Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure,” asked Mr. Peele, as precisely as if
his hair was parted in the middle and plastered on
each side, “that anything is the matter? Does not
the morphine always put him to sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at once. You see he takes it internally, and
it’s twenty minutes or half an hour before it takes effect.
During that time he always groans, for he never takes it
until the last minute. I heard him get up and return
to bed; and then I knew something must be the matter
because he was so quiet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you let him drop it himself?” exclaimed
Mrs. Peele, passionately. “How could you? What
are you here for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offered to drop it for him, but he wouldn’t let me.
I didn’t insist, as he always put it off—and we had
had a quarrel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, something’s got to be done,” said Mr. Peele.
“I don’t like the way he’s beginning to breathe.
There are one or two things we can do until the
doctor comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised Beverly’s arms above the head, brought
them down and pressed them into the chest, repeating
the act twenty or thirty times. Beverly meanwhile was
breathing stertorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I do something?” cried his mother, distractedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we had better walk him,” said Mr. Peele,
whose mouth was tightening. “Call Hickman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The butler was waiting in the hall, and came at once.
He helped Mr. Peele to lift the young man from the
bed. The stalwart figure hung limply between them:
he was as collapsed as the new dead. Mr. Peele and
Hickman walked him up and down the long line of
rooms, shaking him vigorously from time to time;
but they would have produced as much effect upon
the bolster. Mrs. Peele had sunk into a chair. She
sat with compressed lips, and dilating eyes fixed upon
Patience. Honora knelt beside her, patting her hand.
After a time she arose, liberated Mrs. Peele’s hair from
its braid and steels, and arranged it with deft hands,
fetching some of her own amber pins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sat on the edge of the bed. She was
beginning to feel hopelessly sleepy. The day’s excitement
had sapped her nerves. It was now nearly two
o’clock, and she had not slept. Beverly had been ill
the night before and given her little rest. She felt bitterly
ashamed of herself; but every few moments she
was obliged to cover her face with her handkerchief to
conceal a yawn. Once or twice her head dropped
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last time she sat up with a gasp. Mrs. Peele
groaned. The two men had entered with their burden.
Beverly’s face was blue, and he breathed infrequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His body is bathed in a cold perspiration,” said
Mr. Peele. “Will that doctor never come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my God!” murmured Mrs. Peele.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience left the bed and sat on the sill of the window.
The night was very hot and still. A shuddering
horror took possession of her. A palpable presence
seemed skimming the dark gulf under the window.
She sat with distended eyes, half expecting to see a
long arm reach past her and pluck the soul from the
unconscious man on the bed. She closed her eyes and
put her fingers in her ears. When she removed them
she drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor is coming,” she said. “I hear the
wheels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you make him understand what was the
matter?” asked Mr. Peele of the butler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. He said he would bring everything
necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the doctor came in he bent over the sick man
and lifted his eyelids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is morphine poisoning, sure enough,” he said.
“Have some black coffee made. I shall use the electricity
meanwhile. Better telegraph to New York. I
don’t like this case, and don’t want it alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience watched them mechanically for an hour,
then slipped into her own room and into her bed.
Nature had conquered her. Another moment, and she
would have fallen to the floor in sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four hours later she was awakened by a vigorous
shaking of her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat upright and glanced about wildly. “What
is it? What is the matter?” she cried. “I had such
a horrible dream. I thought Beverly was drowning
me—holding me down under the water—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband is dead,” said the doctor. “Do you
wish to go to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shrank under the bedclothes, pulling them
about her head. After the doctor had gone she ran
over to a spare room, opened all the windows to
admit light, then went to bed and slept until late in the
day.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='book5'></a>BOOK V</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The editor-in-chief of the New York “Eye” sat in the
large revolving-chair in his private room, dictating to a
typewriter answers to the great pile of letters on the
desk before him. He opened one letter after another
with expert swiftness, glanced over it, gave it a few lines
of response, or tossed it, half read, into a wastebasket.
But although his heed to duty was alert, his brow was
contracted, and he was carrying on a double train of
thought. The subconsciousness was not pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arnold Sturges was one of the most remarkable men
in New York. Not thirty-three, he had been editor-in-chief
of one of the great newspapers of the United States
for a year and a half. He had elected journalism as the
safety-valve for a superabundant nervous energy and a
means to gratify ambition and love of power. Although
possessed of a little fortune he had begun his career on
the city staff. As a reporter he had worked as hard as
if twenty-five dollars a week stood between him and
starvation. He had risen rapidly from one editorship
to another, and still no half naked man down in
the printing-rooms worked more lustily. His rushing
career was by no means due to work alone, nor yet to
his superlative cleverness: it was said of him that he
could smell news a week off, and not only ahead but
backward; by which was meant that he knew the subtle
and valuable relation that old news occasionally holds to
that of the moment. Naturally, he had made many
brilliant and memorable coups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When friends had blocked his way he had thrust
them aside as lightly as he seemed to spurn less material
obstacles. Body and brain he was the dauntless servant
of the “Eye;” its personality was his; his very nerves
were tuned to its sensational policy. He lived for it,
and would have died for it. He hardly regarded himself
as an individual, although his fine intellect, his bold
executive ability, his splendid suggestions, had been
large factors in the success of the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cold, cruel, charming, calculating, enthusiastic, audacious,
unscrupulous, fearless, relentless, brilliant, executive,
had he been a factor in the French Revolution
his name would have become infamously immortal. As
it was, he was supreme in the field he had deliberately
chosen ten years before, immediately after graduating
from Harvard with such honours that the faculty had sent
for and severally congratulated him upon his future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lived with a soubrette with whom he spent his
evenings, playing <span class='it'>parchisi</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day he was in a serious quandary. Three days
before he had paid fifteen hundred dollars for a scandalous
story relative to one of the most fashionable families
in Westchester County,—a story which bore truth
on the face of it, but which he had not yet published, as
it was necessary to go through the form of verification.
The family meanwhile had heard of the sale, and brought
tremendous pressure to bear upon him to suppress the
story: the owner of the “Eye” was travelling in
Europe. Lawyers had called and harangued. A woman
had gone to his apartment and wept at his feet. A
man had flourished a pistol. For tears and threats he
cared nothing, but it had occurred to him when too late
that the owner of the “Eye” purposed to build in
Westchester County and had aspirations to the Country
Club. Despite the fact that the story would make the
sensation of the day, the owner might be moved to fury.
On the other hand, he had paid fifteen hundred dollars
for the facts, and must justify himself. It was the first
time in his career that he had made a serious mistake,
and he was in a cold rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man would have given pleasure to a physiognomist;
he was a type so marked, so essentially modern,
that an amateur could not have misplaced him, as one
easily could so commonplace a type as Beverly Peele.
His forehead was full and wide, his grey eyes piercing,
restless, hard as ice. The nose was finely cut, the
mouth licentious, the face thin and sallow. At each
extremity of the jaw was an abnormal development of
muscle. His small thin figure was as lithe as a panther,
and so crowded with pure nerve force that it seemed to
shed electricity. His attire was fashionable and elegant.
In flannel shirt and overalls he would still have looked
a product of the higher civilisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened. He wheeled about with a frown,
then smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s you, Van,” he said. “I’ll be through in a
minute. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man that had entered bore so striking a resemblance
to Sturges that the two men might have been
twins. He was, in fact, three years younger than his
brother. Yet there were some points of difference. Van
Cortlandt Sturges’ mouth was a straight line, his hair
was many shades lighter, almost flaxen, and he was
several inches taller. But the expression of the upper
part of the two faces was identical. He, too, had left
Harvard with high honours, and ambition devoured him.
Although only thirty he was District Attorney of Westchester
County. But as yet his fame had not gone
beyond its borders, although within them his dry
incisive bitter eloquence had carried many juries.
Criminals in their cells thought on him with terror. He
had sent several men to the chair, but no man that had
been defended by Garan Bourke. People said of him
lightly that he would not go out of his way to be President
of the United States until he had thrashed Bourke
on his own ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like ten minutes as soon as possible,” he said.
“I have an important communication to make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll hear it now.” To the typewriter: “You can
go. Don’t return until I ring, and tell Tom to stand
in front of the door and admit no one.—Well, what
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you made up your mind to publish that Westchester
County scandal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know anything about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sent for me yesterday and besought me to
use my influence with you. I am engaged to the
woman’s sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil you are! This is bad—bad. But I
can’t do anything. I paid fifteen hundred dollars for
that story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you did. If I could give you a better,
would you let that go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t I? It’s a white elephant. I thought
you didn’t know me so little as to come here with
sentiment. Fire away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you remember the Gardiner Peeles,
although you never go anywhere. You went to one or
two children’s parties there when you were a kid.
Well, Beverly Peele died suddenly night before last,
supposedly of an overdose of morphine administered
by himself. Now, old Lewis, the family physician, is a
great friend of mine, and likely to be communicative in
his cups. Last night he dined with me, and after he
was pretty well loaded told me a remarkable yarn. It
seems that Mrs. Beverly had not been on good terms
with her husband since the early days of their marriage,
and had threatened to leave him from time to time.
He treated her well, and was desperately in love with
her. She, as far as is known, had nothing against him
but personal dislike. She is said to have frequently
expressed hatred of him in violent terms. Well, winter
before last she left him, came to New York, and went to
work on the ‘Day.’ The Peeles did everything to
induce her to return, but she only consented to go
back temporarily this summer to nurse her husband,
who had been attacked with a chronic but not immediately
fatal complaint. Meanwhile it seems she had
fallen in love with some one, and she met him every
Thursday in a wood. Jim, a stable boy, who had been
brought up on the place and was devoted to Beverly
Peele, watched her, but said nothing to his master, as
he was cautiously waiting for some proof of criminality.
On the afternoon of Peele’s death there was a tremendous
scene between the lovers: young Mrs. Peele telling
a furious story of her husband’s refusal to give her
divorce, of his threat to have her watched, to expose
her if she took a lover, and to live until ninety if
he had to go abroad and live at a foreign spa. She
reiterated that she hated him, and had frequently had
the impulse to murder him. The lover invited her to
go to Texas, and she demurred, as she disliked scandal.
Jim told this story to Lewis when driving him home
from the death-bed,—his own horse had cast a shoe,—and
the doctor advised him to keep quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night after the interview between the lovers—or
rather the following morning—Peele died of an overdose
of morphine. She says he took it himself; but it
is a remarkable fact that never before—not in a single
instance—had he dropped the morphine himself. He
had had a nurse from the first, and when the pain was
on he shook like a leaf. And yet she asserts that she
did not drop it that particular night, and adds—by
way of explanation—that they had had a violent quarrel
and he had refused to let her wait on him. While
he was dying and the others were working over him,
she behaved in the most heartless manner,—deliberately
went to bed in the next room and went to sleep.
When Lewis awakened her, however, and told her that
Peele was dead, she displayed symptoms of abject
terror, and tore across the hall and locked herself in
another room. Now, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sturges’ eyes were glittering like smoked diamonds.
“My God!” he cried. “That’s a grand story! a
corker! I’ll have Bart Tripp, the best detective reporter
in New York, up there inside of two hours.
Between whiskey and gold he’ll get every fact out of
the servants they’ve got. It’s worth two of the other.
A young, beautiful, swagger woman accused of murdering
her husband, and that husband a Peele of Peele
Manor! The ‘Eye’ will be read in the very bowels
of the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall conduct the case for the prosecution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ‘Eye’ will let people know it. Don’t worry
about that. Does Lewis remember that he told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word.”</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the following Sunday Patience arose early. Beverly
had been in the family vault down in the hollow for a
week. She had wished to leave immediately after the
funeral, but had remained at the insistence of Hal, who
had returned at once, and was doubly depressed by her
brother’s death and the gloomy house. Mrs. Peele had
gone to bed with a violent attack of neuralgia some
days ago, and had not risen since. Honora was in constant
attendance. Mr. Peele never opened his lips
except to ask for what he wanted. Burr, as a matter
of course, spent the days in New York or at a private
club house in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had moved into a room adjoining Hal’s.
She kept the light burning all night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be all right when I get back to New York,” she
said, “but I have a horror of death. I can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who hasn’t?” asked Hal. “I wish I were a man—or
could be as selfish as one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this Sunday morning Patience rose after a restless
night, and went downstairs as soon as she was
dressed. The “Day” and the “Eye”—Burr’s
favorite newspaper—lay on a table in the hall. She
carried them into the library and turned them over
listlessly, then remembered that a great Westchester
County scandal had been promised for the Sunday
“Eye” by the issue of the day before, and that Hal
and Burr were on the alert, suspecting that they half
knew the story already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened the “Eye” and glanced at the headlines
of the first page. In the place of honour, the
extreme left hand column, she found her story:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>WAS IT MURDER?</p>
<p class='line'>AN OLD MANOR HOUSE IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY MAY</p>
<p class='line'>HAVE BEEN THE THEATRE OF A GREAT CRIME!</p>
<p class='line'>A YOUNG WIFE SUSPECTED OF THE FOUL DEED!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Patience read ten lines. Then she stumbled to
her feet, spilling the papers to the floor. Her skin
felt cold and wet, her knees trembled, her hands
moved spasmodically. Something within her seemed
disintegrating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got to the door and up to her room. Aside from
the horror which sat in each nerve centre and jabbered,
she was conscious of but one idea: she must fly. She
flung off her robe and put on the black frock she had
bought out of deference to the family’s grief. She
scratched herself and thrust the buttons into the wrong
holes, but she could call no one to her assistance. She
was thankful it was so early; she could get away without
encountering any of the family. She was about to
put on her black bonnet when her muddled consciousness
emitted another flash and bade her disguise herself;
detectives would have orders to search for a
woman in weeds. She tore off the mourning frock,
dropping it to the floor, and got herself into a grey one,
then pinned on a grey hat trimmed with pink flowers.
She thrust a few things into a bag, and ran down the
stair. She reached the station in time to flag the 8.30
train for New York. Some one else boarded the same
train, but she did not see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having accomplished her flight, her thoughts travelled
to the objective point. Inevitably her woman’s
instinct turned to the man whose duty it was to protect
her. She convinced herself femininely that if she
could reach him all would be well; he not only loved
her, but he was so amazingly clever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the station in New York she walked deliberately
to a cab and gave the man Morgan Steele’s address.
She looked neither to the right nor to the left, consequently
did not see that the man who had boarded
the train at Peele Manor stood at her elbow when she
gave the order, and followed her immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cab reached the house in which Morgan
Steele lived, she dismissed it and ran up the steps. She
rang again and again, pacing the narrow stoop in an
agony of fear and impatience. At the end of ten
minutes an irritable half dressed Frenchman came
shuffling down the stairs. There were no curtains on
the door, and the man’s expression struck new terror
to her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he asked surlily, as he opened the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—must see Mr. Steele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Steele is asleep. He does not receive visitors
at this hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must see him.” Her cheeks were flaming under
the man’s scrutiny. “Here,” she opened her purse
and gave him a bill, then pushed him aside and ran
upstairs. She remembered that Steele had told her
that his rooms were on the second floor, front. The
halls were as dark as midnight. She had to feel with
her hands for a door. There was one at the end
facing the hall. She knocked so loudly that Steele
sprang out of bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I. Open the door—quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steele made no reply until he opened a door at the
side of the hall. He had tied himself into a bath
robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens!” he said, “why have you come
here? Are you mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I think I am. Lock the door—quick. Oh,
haven’t you heard? Didn’t you know about it before?
The ‘Day’ is right next door to the ‘Eye.’ Why
didn’t you warn me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you talking about? What has
happened? Do sit down and calm yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ‘Eye’ is out with a big story that I murdered
Beverly Peele. That is what is the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Oh, you poor child! The damned rascals!
But you shouldn’t have come here. Don’t you
know that the ‘Eye’ will watch every move you make?
It takes the clever woman to do the wrong thing, every
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the window and peered out, then clenched
his teeth, and raising his arm brought it down violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t put me in prison, can they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed his finger to a bell. “I must read what
they have to say. They are very wary, and never
would have printed such a story unless they had had a
good deal of circumstantial evidence. But they will
need a terrible lot to convict you. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how can you be so cool?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one has to be cool, my dear girl. If you
cannot think I must think for you.” A man has not
much sentiment at that hour of the morning; still,
Steele had sympathy in his nature, and was profoundly
disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant came up with the newspapers, and
Steele ordered coffee and rolls from the restaurant
below. He threw himself into a chair, opened the
“Eye,” and read the story through deliberately, word
for word, while Patience walked nervously up and
down the room. When he had finished he laid the
newspaper on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a damned bad case,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe I did it, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her for a moment with his peculiarly
searching gaze. “No,” he said, “you didn’t do it.
You’d be even more interesting if you had. But
that’s not the question. We’ve got to make others
believe you didn’t do it. The first thing for you to do
is to go directly back to Peele Manor. Tell them you
came up to see Miss Merrien and to engage rooms.
Anything you like—only go back there and wait. If
you are arrested, it must be from there, and there must
be no suggestion of fear on your part—you must
brace up and carry it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter entered with the coffee and rolls, and
Steele made her drink and eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is 9.45,” he said. “You can catch a train that
goes between ten and eleven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience had finished she drew on her gloves.
“I’ll go,” she said, “and I’ll try to do as you say.
I’ve made a fool of myself, but I won’t again—I
promise. I can be as cold as stone, you know. That’s
the New England part of me. And so long as I know
that you care I sha’n’t break down—in public at
least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I care fast enough—poor little woman.
Here, leave that bag, for heaven’s sake. You mustn’t
go back with that.”</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience arrived at Peele Manor she knew
before she reached the house that her story had been
read and told. The gardener turned on his heel as
she passed him and walked hastily away. A new stable
boy stared at her until she thought his eyes would fly
from their sockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she entered the front door, Hal ran forward and
threw her arms about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patience! Patience!” she sobbed hysterically.
“That brutal paper! How could they do such a
thing? Have they no heart nor soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe it then?” said Patience, gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t believe it—believe such a thing
of <span class='it'>you</span>! Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come back. They
were all sure you’d run away; but I knew you hadn’t.
It is only the guilty that hide—But why on earth did
you put on that grey frock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. How can one know what one’s
doing—What does your father say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were in one of the small reception-rooms.
Hal removed Patience’s hat and gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this has been the most terrible day of my
life,” she said evasively. “But you must be prudent,
Patience dear. You must wear black—What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A servant had entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Peele would like to see Mrs. Beverly in the
library!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience rose and shook herself a little, as if she
would shake her nerves into place. Hal’s face flushed,
and she turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patience crossed the hall she met Latimer Burr.
He held out his hand and pressed hers warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is terrible, Patience,” he said; “but remember
that Hal and I are always your friends. If the worst
comes to the worst I’ll send you my attorney. Remember
that, and don’t engage any one else, for he’s
one of the ablest criminal lawyers in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are good!” she said. She smiled even
through the grateful tears which sprang to her eyes.
Burr had grown a visible inch. His chest and lips
were slightly extended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele sat in a large chair, his elbows on the
arms, his finger-tips lightly pressed together. As
Patience stood before him she felt as if transfixed by
two steel lances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You murdered my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not.” Her courage came back to her under
the overt attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You murdered my son. The evidence is conclusive
to me as a lawyer—and to my knowledge of you.
My error was that I regarded your threats as feminine
ravings. I wish you to leave my house at once—within
the hour. I shall not have you arrested, but
if you are I shall appear against you; and I have some
evidence, as you will admit. You have dishonoured an
ancient house,” he continued with cold passion, “and
you have left it without an heir. Its name, after nearly
three hundred years in this country alone, must die
with me. If you had borne a son I should move
heaven and earth to get you out of the country, but now
I hope to heaven you’ll go to the chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shuddered and chilled, but she answered:
“You despised your son, and you should be thankful
that he left no second edition of himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was my son, and the last of his name. Now,
kindly leave this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience went up to her room and began to pack
her trunk. Hal followed, and when she heard what
her father had said cried bitterly. She helped Patience
to pack, assisted her into the black clothes, then walked
to the station with her and stood conspicuously on the
platform, waving her hand as the train moved off.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience went directly to her old quarters in Forty-Fourth
Street. She told the cabman not to lift her
trunk down until she ascertained if there was a vacant
room in the house. The bell was answered by a maid
that had been there in her time. The girl stifled a
scream and fled. Patience shut the door behind her
with a hand that trembled again, and went slowly upstairs
to Miss Merrien’s room. A solemn voice answered
her knock. When she opened the door Miss
Merrien sprang up and came forward. Her face was
drawn, her eyes were red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Peele!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe it? If you do, I’ll go at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t believe it! How can you ask
me? Sit down. How good of you to come here. Tell
me—are you terribly frightened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think I am now. Why should I be?
If I am so unlucky as to have been tossed up in the
news hat of the ‘Eye,’ I cannot help it; and I suppose
this is only the beginning. If I have to go to jail I
have to, and that is the end of it; but they cannot
possibly convict me, for I am innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you always were the bravest woman I ever
knew. It is like you—Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and the landlady entered and closed
it carefully behind her. She was a tall thin elderly
woman with a refined face stamped with commercial
unquiet. Her grey hair was piled high. Her voice
was low, and well modulated. She looked at Patience
out of faded blue eyes in which there was a faint sparkle
of resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that you have a trunk on your cab, Mrs.
Peele,” she said, “I am very sorry that I have no
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no intention of asking you for a room,” said
Patience, haughtily. “I merely came to call on Miss
Merrien; and as I have only a few moments to spare, I
should be obliged if you would leave us alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlady retired in disorder, and Miss Merrien
exhausted her vocabulary of invective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the use?” said Patience. “She is right.
In the struggle for bread and butter it must be self first,
last, and always. If it were known—as it would be—that
I had been arrested from her house every other
lodger would leave. Well, I must go roof-hunting.”
She laughed suddenly. “If I do go to jail I suppose
you’ll come to interview me. I hope so. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien, although not a demonstrative girl,
kissed her affectionately. “The ‘Day’ will defend you
for all it’s worth—you know that. And I needn’t say
anything about myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience told her cabman to drive to the Holland
House, but when he stopped there she did not get out.
Reflection had convinced her that no hotel in New
York would take her in. She dared not give a false
name lest her motive should be misconstrued. She
put her head out of the window and gave the man
Rosita’s address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no other way,” she thought. “I cannot
live in a cab. Mrs. Field would take me in, but I
have no right to make such a test of friendship as
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita received her with open arms. She was looking
very beautiful in flowing nainsook and lace, and exhaled
a new and delicious perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita! Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>!” she purred. “<span class='it'>Pobrecita!</span>
Who would have thought that this would happen to my
<span class='it'>lili</span>.” (Her accent was more pronounced than ever.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I stay with you until they arrest me, or this
blows over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall stay with me forever. ‘Are we not bound
by the ties of childhood?’ That is a line in my new
opera. Isn’t it funny? Ay, Patita, I am so sorry.”
And she sent down for the trunk and removed Patience’s
hat.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Patience was awakened by Rosita’s
ecstatic voice. She opened her eyes to see her hostess
standing at the bedside, the “Eye” in her hand, her
face radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita!” she cried. “Read it—there is a whole
column about you and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience sat up in bed. “Is that why you were so
glad to have me come here?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patita! Do not look at me like that. Oh, if I
could only look that way when I am stage mad!—but
they always say I look like an angry baby. Of course,
that was not the reason, Patita <span class='it'>mia</span>; but it is heavenly
to be written about; do not you think so? And, of
course, every new story about me—and such a sensation
as this—means a perfect rush—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the paper, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She read the column while Rosita pattered back to
her room and ate her dainty breakfast. Every move
she had made on the day before was chronicled. On
another page an editorial commented on the facts of
her having visited a young man’s apartment, and finally
taken refuge with the notorious Spanish woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dressed herself hastily in her black garments,
and locked and strapped her trunk. “I’ll go straight
down and give myself up,” she thought. “It’s what I
ought to have done yesterday. It’s eleven o’clock. I
wish it were nine. Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two gentlemen to see madame,” said the maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—who—what do they look like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like policemen, and yet not, madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience gasped. Her knees gave way. Again she
experienced that horrible feeling of disintegration. Her
untasted breakfast stood on a table by the bed. She
hastily drank a cup of black coffee, then walked steadily
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have come for me?” she asked of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the jail at White Plains, Westchester County.
You are arrested on charge of murder;” and he displayed
the warrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience touched the bell button. “Take my trunk
downstairs to the cab,” she said to the butler. Then she
stepped to the portières and said good-bye to Rosita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a cool one,” said one man to the other.
“She done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down in the elevator. As they left it,
one of the men preceded her, the other followed close.
Both entered the cab with her. She felt that they were
regarding her with the frank curiosity of their kind,
and kept her eyes fixed on the street with an expressionless
stare. On the train they gave her a seat to
herself, each taking the outside of another, one before
and one behind. The passengers did not suspect the
meaning of the party. She saw no one she knew. It
was not the line that passed Peele Manor. For small
mercies she was duly thankful. She guessed, however,
that a meagre wiry black-eyed young man on the
opposite side of the aisle, a man with a mean sharp
common face, was Bart Tripp. He stared at her until
she thought she should scream aloud, or, what would
be almost as fatal, relax the proud calm of her face. It
was with a sigh of profound relief that she stepped
from the train at White Plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t meet no one,” said one of the detectives,
as they entered the hack. “The sheriff’s got ready
for you, I guess; he was wired yesterday; but we took
good care not to say what train we was coming on,
so there wouldn’t be no crowd. Feeling’s pretty high
against you, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drove through the ugly little town, Patience
wondered why it was called White Plains. She had
never seen a more undulating country. One or two of
the environing hills were almost perpendicular. She
also noticed with the minute observance of persons approaching
crises, that the court house was a big handsome
building of grey stone, and decided that she
liked its architecture. The extension behind, one of
the keepers told her, was the jail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was escorted before a police justice, who read
the charge and explained such privileges as the law
allowed her; then to the sheriff’s office, where she was
registered. A crowd of men were in the office. They
watched her with deep but respectful attention, as she
answered the many questions put to her, but she managed
to maintain her impassive demeanour. There was
a buzz of excitement by this time all through the court
house, and a little of it began to communicate itself to
her. The few that are sustained through life’s trials
by public interest are immeasurably fortunate. Before
the sheriff—who could not have treated her with more
consideration were she a dethroned queen—had finished,
word had gone up into the court room, and a
sudden trampling on the back stair indicated that the
case in hand had lost its interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all,” said the sheriff, hurriedly. “Guess
you’d better get along.—Tarbox,” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short stout man with a ruddy kind face came
forward, offered Patience his arm, pushed his way
through the crowd of men in the hall, and led her out
of a back door and down a long yard beside the jail.
At the end of the building he inserted a key in a lock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go right up, ma’am,” he said politely, and she ascended
a narrow flight of stairs. At its head he unlocked
another door, and again they ascended, again
a door was unlocked. Then Patience stepped into a
long low clean well-lighted room. In the middle of
its length was a stove over which a kettle boiled. On
a bench sat four women. At each end and on one
side were low grated windows. On the other side were
a number of grated doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man led Patience to the upper end of the room
and swung open the door of the corner cell. It was a
large cell, and had it not been for the low window with
its iron bars would have been in no wise different from
any room of simple comfort. A red carpet covered the
floor. The bed in the corner was fresh and spotless.
The rest of the furniture was new and convenient.
There were even a large rocker and a student’s lamp.
Over the door a curtain had been hung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why!” exclaimed Patience, “are all prison cells
like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, they’re not; but you see when we
have a lady—which isn’t often—we do what we can
to make her feel at home. We can’t afford to forget
that this is the swell county of New York, you know.
And of course you’re the finest person we’ve ever had.
You’ll be treated well here,—you needn’t worry about
that. I’ll order one of them girls outside to wait on
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very good.” For the first time tears
threatened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll try to be to you, ma’am. I’m John
Tarbox, deputy sheriff, jailor, warden, and all the rest
of it. I shall look after you. I’ll call twice a day, and
anything you want you’ll get. If any of them hussies
out there get to fighting just sing out the window, and
I’ll lock them up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t lock me in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no—there’s no need for that. This cell’s no
stronger than the whole place. Well, make yourself
comfortable. I’ll send over to the hotel to get a lunch
for you. You must be hungry. Keep a stiff upper lip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience, when she was alone, drew a long breath
and looked about her. The cheerful room, the unexpected
kindness of the sheriffs, had raised her spirits.
She took off her hat and tossed it on the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well take the situation humourously,” she
thought. “It helps more than anything else in life,
I’ve discovered. This can’t last forever, and they
can’t convict me. The serious people of this world
have always struck me as being the most farcical. So
here goes my ninth or tenth lesson in philosophy.
Such is life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon Mag, the improvised maid, unpacked
the trunk and shook out the pretty garments with many
expressions of rapture. Patience gave her a red frock,
and the girl was her slave thenceforth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon hours revolved like a clogged wheel in
a muddy stream. Excitement and novelty kept horror
at bay, but she knew that it lurked, biding its time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When night came she lit the lamp and tried to read
a magazine that Tarbox had brought her; but it fell
from her hands again and again. Her ears acted independently
of her will. She had never known so
terrible a stillness. The women had gone to bed at
half past seven. No voice came from the distant street.
The silence of eternity seemed to have descended upon
those massive walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in jail!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet, shuddering; then set her
teeth and knelt by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heat waves of August hid the stars. Beyond the
jail-yard was a mass of buildings, but no light in any
window. Now and again a tramp came forth from his
quarters on the ground floor and strolled about the yard,
smoking his pipe; but he made no sound, and in his
grey dilapidation looked like a parodied ghost. One
of the women cursed loudly in her sleep, then collapsed
into silence. An engine whistle shrieked, hilarious with
freedom, but the rattle of the train was too distant to
carry to straining ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clutched the bars and shook them, then crouched,
trembling and gasping. She dropped forward, resting
her face on her arms. Her fine courage retreated, and
mocked her. She had no wish to recall it. She longed
passionately for the strong arm and the strong soul of
a man. The independence and self-reliance which
Circumstance had implanted, seemed to fade out of
her; she was woman symbolised. No shipwrecked
mariner was ever so desolate; for nothing in all life is
so tragic as a woman forced to stand and do battle
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only when she arose, shivering and exhausted,
and groped her way to bed, that it occurred to her that
in those appalling moments she had not thought of
Morgan Steele.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning she awoke with a start and a chill, and
sprang out of bed, governed by an impulse to fling herself
against the bars. But sleep had refreshed her, and
she sat down and reasoned herself into courage and
hope once more. The tussle with the world develops
the iron in a woman’s blood, and Patience’s experiences
of the last year and a half stood her in good
stead now. When the girl came in to arrange her
room and Tarbox brought her breakfast, the commonplace
details completed her poise. The morning mail
brought her letters from Steele and Hal.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Girl</span> [Steele’s ran],—You are blue and frightened
and lonesome. I wish I were there to cheer you
up. But the first day will be the worst. Remember that
liberty is not far off. They cannot convict you. I shall
see you a few hours after you get this.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>M. S.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Patience dear [Hal had written], it has come! I
wish I could tell you how terribly I feel. But cheer up, old
girl. It will come out all right—I know it will. Latimer
is hustling me out of the country so I cannot appear as a
witness—he says I would do you more harm than good.
But he will stay and see you through. His attorney will
call on you at once. I send you a box to cheer you up a
little. Do write to me, and always remember that I am
your sister</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Hal</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The box arrived an hour later. It contained her
silver toilet-set, and all the paraphernalia of a well-groomed
and pretty woman, a bottle of cologne, a box
of candy, eight French novels, a large box of handsome
writing paper, and a bolt of black satin ribbon.
Patience arranged the toilet-set on the bureau, halved
the candy with the women, then sat down with a volume
of Bourget. When Tarbox came up an hour later with
a card she was still reading, and quite herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “I’m glad, I am, to see you so
contented and so cool,” he added, mopping his brow.
“This gent is below. He says he’s one of the lawyers
in the case. I hoped you’d have Bourke. He’s the
smartest man in Westchester County! Shall I tell him
to come up, or would you like to see him down in the
sheriffs office? Anything to please you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here, by all means, if he doesn’t mind the
stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tarbox gazed at her admiringly. “Well, ma’am,” he
ejaculated, “you are cool, but I for one believe it’s the
coolness of innocence. You never did murder!” and
he walked hastily away as if ashamed of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer’s card bore the name of Eugene A.
Simms. He came up at once, a short thick-set man of
thirty, with a square shrewd dogged face, a low brow,
a snub nose, and black brilliant hard eyes. He came
in with a bustling aggressive business-like air, scanning
Patience as if he expected to find all the points of the
case written upon her. Patience conceived an immediate
and violent dislike to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you sit down?” she said stiffly. “You are Mr.
Burr’s lawyer, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. That’s Bourke. He has charge of the
case. I’m getting it up. I shall attend the coroner’s
inquest and get the case in shape for Mr. Bourke to
conduct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood rose to Patience’s hair and receded to her
heart, which changed its time; but she asked no
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simms leaned forward and fixed her with his unpleasant
eyes. “Be perfectly frank with me,” he said,
abruptly. “It’s best. We can’t work in the dark.
We’ll pull you through; that’s what we are here for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take it for granted that I am guilty, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m bound to say that all the revealed facts point
that way. But of course that makes no difference to
us. In fact, the harder a case is the better Bourke
likes it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Mr. Bourke believe that I am guilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t discussed it with him. He merely called
me in, put the facts in my hands, and told me to go to
work. I haven’t seen him since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be perfectly frank with you,” said Patience,
who had recovered herself. “I did not murder Mr.
Peele. I am not wholly an idiot. If I had wished to
poison him do you suppose I would have selected the
drug I was known to administer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might have done it in a moment of passion.
You had had a quarrel with him that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the more reason why I would not make
such a fatal mistake. It is quite true that when in a
passion I frequently expressed the wish to kill him. I
will also tell you that one night when dropping the
morphine I was seized with an uncontrollable impulse
to give him a double dose. I dropped twenty-six
drops. But fortunately it takes some time to do that,
and meanwhile the impulse weakened, and I anathematised
myself as a fool. No man nor woman of respectable
brains ever made a mistake like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your own theory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly believe that he committed suicide. I
think that he was wild with pain, and did not count the
drops. He was probably half blind. On the other
hand, he was capable of anything when in a rage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Simms scraped the floor with his boot-heels and
beat a tattoo on his knee with his fingers. “Very well,”
he said at last. “We take your word, of course. Now
tell me as nearly as you can, every circumstance of
that night, and give me a general idea of your relations
with him and your reasons for leaving him. It is going
to be one of the biggest fights this State has ever seen,
and we want all the help you can give us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone Patience fell into a rage. Why
had not Bourke come himself instead of sending his
underling? If he hesitated to meet her after the
abominable words he had used that second night at
Peele Manor why had he undertaken her case at all?
Her pride revolted at the thought of being defended
by him, of owing her life to him. Once she was at the
point of writing him a haughty note declining to accept
his services; but Latimer Burr’s kindness deserved a
more gracious acknowledgment. Again, she took up
her pen to inform him that unless he apologised he
must understand that she could have no relations with
him; but her lively fear of making herself ridiculous
came to the rescue, and she threw the pen aside. She
resumed her novel, but it had lost its flavour. Bourke’s
face was on every page. The interview in the elm walk
wrote itself between the French lines; and the subsequent
conversation in the library danced in letters of
red. She hated Bourke the more bitterly because he
had once been something more to her than any other
man had been. She worked herself into such a bad
humour that she almost snubbed Miss Merrien and a
“Day” artist who came to interview and sketch her;
and when Morgan Steele arrived, late in the afternoon,
she was as perverse and unreasonable as if the widowed
châtelaine of Peele Manor with the world at her feet.
He understood her mood perfectly, although not the
cause of it, and guyed her into good humour and her
native sense of the ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do like you,” she said. “You understand
me so. Any other man would go off in a huff. And I
won’t always be like this. I suppose I am nervous and
upset and all the rest of it. Who wouldn’t be? And
you know I am tremendously fond of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you are,” he said dryly. “As you will have
ample time for reflection and meditation in the next
few months, you will find out just how fond. But I am
more glad than I can say to find you in this mood. It
is as healthy as irritability in illness. I am even willing
to be sacrificed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience put out her hand and patted his soft hair
with a spasm of genuine affection. “You are the
dearest boy in the world,” she said, “and I do love you.
For all your uncanny wisdom and cold-blooded philosophy
you are just a big lovable good-natured boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the kind of fellow a woman would like to have
for a brother, in short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! I think it will be the most charming
thing in the world to be married to you. You are
such a compound. You will interest me forever. Most
people are such bores after a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you hadn’t started out in life with ideas upside-down,
you would really love me in loving me no more
than you do now. But ideals and the fixed idea have
got to be worked out to the bitter end, as you are fond
of remarking. In reality, happiness means a comfortable
state of affairs between a man and a woman with
plenty of brains, philosophy, and passion, who are
wholly congenial in these three matters, and have
chucked their illusions overboard. However, we won’t
discuss the matter any further at present. How do
you like being the sensation of the day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you? Every newspaper in town had a big
story this morning, and of course the news has gone
all over the country. Nothing else is to be heard in
the trains or in Park Row. Oh, you will have plenty
to sustain you. Lots of women would give their heads
to be in your place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dined with her and remained until eight o’clock.
After he had gone, Patience sat for some time lost in
a pleasurable reverie. He always left her in a good
humour, and she unquestionably loved him. Few
women could help loving Morgan Steele. She sighed
once as she reflected that love was not the tremendous
passion she had once imagined it to be; in all her
dreams she had never pictured it as a restful and
tranquillising element; but she conceded that Steele’s
philosophy was correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if he did not inspire her with a mightier passion
it was her fault, not his. Miss Merrien had told her of
one brilliant newspaper woman who had made a wilful
idiot of herself on his behalf, and of a popular and
gifted actress who at one time had taken to haunting
the “Day” office, much to the enjoyment of his fellow
editors and to his own futile wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she thought, “I made a mistake once, and
the shock was so great that it either benumbed or
stunted me; or else the imaginary me was killed and
the real developed. And after such a marriage I doubt
if there are depths or heights left in one’s nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then her mind drifted to her predicament, and she
wondered that the workings of fear had so wholly
ceased. “I suppose it is because that man is going to
defend me,” she said, ruthlessly, at last. “They say
he could save a man that had been caught driving a
knife into another man’s heart with a hammer; so it is
quite natural that I should feel safe.”</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next day a box of books and periodicals arrived
from Steele. Rosita thoughtfully subscribed to a clipping
bureau, and sent Patience daily a heavy package of
“stories,” editorials, and telegrams of which she was the
heroine. Patience became so bewildered over the contradictory
descriptions of her personal appearance, the
various versions of her marital drama, the hundred and
one theories for the murder and defence, the ingenious
analyses of her character, and the conflicting information
regarding her girlhood, that she wondered sometimes
if a person could come forth from the hands of
so many creators and retain any original birthmarks.
The “Eye” telegraphed to its correspondent in San
Francisco to investigate her childhood, and the correspondent
evidently interviewed all her old enemies.
Her mother’s happy career was detailed with glee, and
her own “sulky, moody, eccentric, murderous propensities”
were brilliantly epitomised. The story was entitled
“She Tried To Murder Her Mother,” and the
“Eye’s” perfervid joy at this discovery throbbed in an
editorial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was copied the length and breadth of the
United States; but it is only fair to add that Mr.
Field’s eloquent leaders in her defence were as widely
quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale came to see her at once, and after a few
tears and an emphatic warning that “this terrible ordeal
was the logical punishment of her blasphemy of and
disrespect to the Lord,” announced her intention to sit
by her during the trial, and let the jury see what a
president of the W. C. T. U. thought of a prisoner whose
life was in their hands. Patience told her that she
loved her, and indeed was deeply grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spent her mornings reading the newspapers and
attending to her correspondence. Tarbox always paid
her a short call, and usually discoursed of Garan Bourke,
whom he admired extravagantly. For a half hour before
luncheon she permitted her fellow prisoners to sit
before her in a wondering semi-circle while she manicured
her nails and drew vivid word-pictures of the
superior comforts incident upon the resignation of alcohol.
With the exception of Mag they were weather-beaten
creatures, with hollow eyes and weak pathetic
mouths. They admired Patience superlatively. She
was touched by their devotion, and occasionally read
them the funny stories in the illustrated weeklies.
They listened with open mouth and voiceless laughter,
which, however, expressed itself vocally when the stories
were told in Irish or German dialect. Patience gave
them the papers, and they pasted the pictures on the
walls of the corridor. Never before had the female
ward of the White Plains Jail presented so festive an
appearance. When the W. C. T. U. ladies came to sing
to the prisoners they were inclined to be horrified;
but Patience assured them that love of art, however
manifested, was a hopeful sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very comfortable. She had saved a thousand
dollars,—to be exact, Miss Merrien had saved
them for her,—and she could command all the small
luxuries of prison life. The ugly walls of her cell had
been draped with red cloth, and a low bookcase was
rapidly filling with the literature of the moment. She
would never have consented to save those thousand
dollars had not Miss Merrien represented that by judicious
economy she could manage to spend every third
year abroad. They did her good service now; she
could accept great favours, but not small ones. Graceful
tributes were to be expected by every charming
woman; but if she had been dependent upon friends
for the small comforts of her daily life she would have
gone without them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The W’s and Y’s of Mariaville forgave her, and
brought her flowers, tracts, and spiritual admonitions.
She received the former with gratitude and the latter
with grace. Miss Merrien came as often as her duties
permitted, and so did all the other newspaper women
she had ever known or heard of. She was interviewed
for nearly every newspaper in the Union, and in most
cases treated with sensational kindness. Many strangers
and a few old friends called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steele came regularly once a week. He dared not
come oftener. The “lover in the case” was still a
mystery, and it was as well that he should remain so.
Five other newspaper men lived in his house; therefore
Patience’s visit had told Bart Tripp nothing beyond the
fact that she had indubitably called on a young man
at his apartments at a quarter past nine in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But despite the fact that much of her time was
occupied Patience grew very restless and nervous,
after the novelty wore off. She spent hours pacing up
and down the corridor, and every evening after dark
Tarbox took her out in the jail-yard for a walk; but
she had been used to long walks and hours in the open
air all her life, and no woman ever lived less suited to
routine and restraint of any sort. Fear did not return,
although the coroner’s jury had pronounced her guilty
and she had been indicted by the Grand Jury.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When the dark days of winter came little light
struggled through the low grating, and she was obliged
to keep her lamp burning most of the time. Steele
sent her one with a rose-coloured shade which shed a
cheerful light but hurt her eyes. When the storms
began visitors came infrequently. Moreover, as public
interest cannot be kept at concert pitch for any length
of time, there was less and less about her in the newspapers.
Steele, who understood the intimate relationship
between public interest and the resignation of a
prisoner, assured her that when her trial came off in
March she would once more be the popular news of
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the monotony of the long silent winter days
was intolerable. But gradually, by such short degrees,
that she hardly realised the change taking place within
her, she grew to love her solitude and to be grateful
for it. For the first time since she had left Monterey
her hours were absolutely her own. She had longed
for the solitude of a forested mountain top. From her
prison window she could see the naked tops of a clump
of trees above the buildings opposite, and even her
obedient imagination could not expand them to primeval
heights; but at least she had solitude and not a
petty detail to annoy her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sometimes wondered if it mattered where one
spent the few years of this unsatisfactory life. Nothing
was of permanent satisfaction. Strongly as she had
been infatuated with newspaper work the interest would
have lasted only just so long. She found her modernity
slipping from her, herself relapsing into the dreaming
child of the tower with vague desire for something her
varied experience of the world had not helped her to
find. Inevitably she came to know herself and the
large demands of her nature, and as inevitably she said
to Morgan Steele one day,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you have known all along that it was a
mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I have known it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have everything—everything,—good looks
and distinction, brains and modernity, magnetism of a
queer cold sort, knowledge of women and kindness of
heart—I cannot understand. But the spark, the response,
the exaltation is not there,—the splendid rush
of emotion. I love you, but not in the way that makes
matrimony marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with his peculiar smile, an expansion
of one corner of his mouth which gave him something
of the expression of a satyr. “You were badly in
need of a companion, and you found one in me. You
wanted to be understood, and I understood you. You
wanted sympathy, and I sympathised with you; but I
am not the man, and I have never for one moment
deluded myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why would you have allowed me to drift into
matrimony with you?—as I should have done if I had
not come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the experiment would have been no more
dangerous than most matrimonial experiments. And
it would have been very delightful for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have loved you a good deal,” she said
musingly, “and habit is a tremendous force. And I
should never have permitted myself to recognise a
mistake again—if the decisive step had been taken.
Tell me—” she added abruptly, “do you believe that
if I had married you that you would always have loved
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly should never have been so unwise as to
promise to, for that is something no man can foretell.
The chances are that I should not. All phases of feeling
are temporary,—all emotions, all desires, all fulfilment.
Life itself is temporary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you have been true to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O-h-h, how in thunder can a man answer a
question like that? That is something he never knows
till the time comes. If he is sensible he wastes no
time making resolutions, and if he is honest he makes
no promises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not love me,” she exclaimed triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am merely more honest, perhaps more analytical
than most men,—that is all. The man who swears
he will love forever the woman that pleases him most
is simply talking from the depths of ignorance straight
up through his hat. No man knows anything—what
he will do or feel to-morrow. He knows nothing of
himself until his time comes to die, and then he knows
blamed little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shook her head. “I don’t know. You
may be right in the analysis, but I think you lose a
good deal. Love may be a species of insanity, but the
man whose brain is crystal is not to be envied by the
man whose brain can scorch reason and thought at
times. You may save yourself heartbreak, but you
miss heaven. If you are a type of the future, woman
will change too. Man has been at woman’s feet
throughout the centuries. You and your kind will
place her on an exact level with yourselves and teach her
that love means a comfortable coupling of personalities.
Something primitive has gone out of you. You have
every ingredient in your make-up except love. Liking
and passion don’t make love. When it fades out of man
altogether chivalry and homage will go with it. You
would do a great deal for me, but you are incapable of
any splendid self-sacrifice. You are entirely selfish,
although in the most charming way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite right,” he said smiling, “I have not
much love in me; just enough to make life a comfortable
and pleasant sojourn, but not enough to induce a
regret were I obliged to toss it over to-morrow—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor to make it a life of bitter misery did I leave
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—to be perfectly frank I should not be bitterly
miserable. I should regret—but I should work and
readjust myself. I have never yet given a glance to the
past. I give few to the future. No man gets more out
of the present—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t be loved like that,” said Patience, passionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward and took her hand, patting it
gently. “You have depths and heights in your nature
which I fully appreciate but which I could never stir
nor satisfy,” he said. “Some man will. It won’t be
all that you expect—you have too much imagination—but
you will have your day. With your nature that
is inevitable. I am sorry to give you up. You are the
most delightful woman I shall ever know. And if you
had married me things would probably have gone along
satisfactorily enough. I should have kept your mind
occupied and talked to you about yourself—those are
the secrets of success in matrimony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marriage with you would be like playing at matrimony.
I want a home and husband and children.
I have seen enough to know that unless one is a fanatic
like Miss Tremont or Miss Beale, or the temporary
result of a new and forced civilisation like Hal, or a
mercenary wanton like Rosita—in short, if one is
woman <span class='it'>par excellence</span>, and most of us, clever or otherwise,
even gifted, usually are, nothing else is worth the
toil and perplexity of being alive. But you mustn’t
leave me,” she added hurriedly; “I can’t stand it here
if you don’t come to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall come exactly as I have done. Why not?
Our love-making has barely progressed beyond friendship:
we shall hardly recognise any change. I should
feel lost if I could not have a talk with you once in a
while. I intend to have that for the rest of my life.
It isn’t usually the man that proposes the brother
racket, but I merely define the basis upon which we
have really stood all along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone Patience drew a long sigh of
relief. The first terrible mistake of her life was buried
with Beverly Peele. A second had been averted.
Something seemed rebuilding within her: the undeflected
continuation of the little girl in the tower.
For the first time she understood herself as absolutely
as mortal can; and she paid a tribute to the zigzag of
life which had helped her to that final understanding.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the third of February she received a letter, the
handwriting of whose address made her change colour:
she had seen it once on Mrs. Peele’s desk. It was the
first communication of any sort that she had received
from the man who was to defend her life. She opened
the letter with angry curiosity.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My dear Mrs. Peele</span>, [it read],—You will pardon me
I am sure for not having called before this when I tell you
that I have had a rush of civil cases which have hardly
given me time for sleep and have kept me constantly in
New York. And of course you have understood that there
was really nothing I could do until my able confederate,
Mr. Simms, had gathered in and digested all the facts in
the case. Now, however, I am free, and the time has come
when I shall be obliged to see you twice a week until the
first of March. I have worked the harder in order to be
at liberty to devote myself wholly to your case. Need I
add how absolute that devotion will be, my dear Mrs. Peele,
or how entirely every resource I possess shall be at your
service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two o’clock on Monday I shall be in the sheriff’s
private office with Mr. Simms and my assistant, Mr. Lansing.
Will you kindly meet us there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>With highest regard, I am, dear Mrs. Peele,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Garan Bourke</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patience read this carefully worded epistle twice,
then laughed and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad he has declared himself,” she thought.
“Of course I should have ignored the past, but it is a
relief to think that there will be no awkwardness.”</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On Monday at two o’clock Tarbox came up to her
cell to escort her down to the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bourke’s there, and I never saw him looking better,”
he said, rubbing his hands. “Oh, he’ll pull you through.
Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was very nervous, but her years of self-repression
and her experience at Peele Manor had
forged a key with which she could at times lock nerve
and muscle into subjection. As she entered the sheriff’s
office she smiled upon Mr. Bourke as graciously as any
young and beautiful woman would be expected to smile
upon a great lawyer enlisted in her service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke came forward with the same ballast, although
the red was in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was better for you to come down here,” he said.
“There could be no privacy in your cell, and we must
have absolute privacy for these meetings. Of course
you know that we are going to rehearse you. Mrs.
Peele, this is my assistant, Mr. Lansing.” He indicated
a good-looking well-dressed young fellow, with boyish
blue eyes and a tilted nose. She liked him at once
and gave him her hand. Mr. Simms had risen as she
entered, and they had nodded distantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this chair, Mrs. Peele,” continued Bourke.
“Yes. This is the first of many rehearsals. We shall
keep them up until the trial. You will imagine yourself
on the witness stand. Mr. Simms, whom, fortunately,
you don’t like, is the district attorney, Lansing is the
judge, I am the counsel for the defence. I shall
make the direct examination, and then Mr. Simms will
cross-examine you with all the subtlety, the venom, and
the irritating minutiæ of a district attorney determined
to make himself immortal. I think we have outlined
with reasonable completeness all that will or can be
asked you, so that you can hardly be taken off your
guard: you must be prepared to give direct answers
without suspicious promptness, and avoid saying anything
that could be misconstrued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I go on the stand?” asked Patience, fearfully.
“I thought one was not obliged to, and I shall be so
nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke shook his head emphatically. “The judge
might reiterate a hundred times to the jury that your
failure to go on the witness stand should not be counted
against you, and still it would count—more than anything.
It is something a jury never overlooks. These
rehearsals are to keep you from being nervous, as much
as anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe I am innocent?” asked Patience,
giving way to an uncontrollable impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do—both personally and professionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simms laughed. “Bourke is so enthusiastic,” he
said, “that if he had made up his professional mind that
you were innocent, the personal would follow suit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I do,” said Bourke, laughing, and looking
at Patience with eyes which for the moment were more
kind than keen. “Now, here goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the two hours’ rehearsal were over she was
very pale. “I did not know the case could look so
black,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a black case,” said Simms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really take so much interest?” she asked
Bourke, curiously. “You make me feel as if the issue
were yours and not mine. Or is that only your professional
pride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bourke is the most ambitious man at the New York
bar,” said Simms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the most human,” added Lansing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience smiled at the young man and turned to
Bourke, whose eyes were twinkling. “I take a very
deep personal interest in your case,” he said gallantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bourke is an Irishman,” said Simms, with sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll excuse you,” said Bourke. “You know you
have business with Sturges,” and Simms gathered up
his papers and retired, followed by Lansing. As the
door closed Bourke’s face changed. He became serious
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Peele,” he said, “it would be foolish and
unkind to conceal from you the fact that you are in a
very grave position. I have never known a more damaging
chain of circumstantial evidence. The only jury
we can possibly get together, the only men in Westchester
County who will know nothing about the case,
will be farmers and small tradespeople. These men
are narrow minded, unworldly, religious, bigoted people
who will look with horror upon a woman accused of
murder; who will be surlily prejudiced against you
because you did not love your husband, and because
you left him; and above all they are likely to think you
should be executed if for no other reason than because,”—He
hesitated. The blood came into his face.
“Tell me, is it true? I don’t believe it. I can’t
believe it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I had a lover? No, I did not have a lover.
If that spy reports exactly what he heard, he must himself
prove that I did not. I liked—I do like—a
man, a former editor of mine, immensely. At that
time I believed myself in love with him; but I was as
mistaken as I suppose all impulsive and mentally lonely
people are once or oftener in their lifetimes. Although
he visits me now we have come to a complete understanding.
I shall not marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke looked at the floor for a moment. “Yes,”
he said finally. “Yes. That is a great point, of course.
Well—as a rule I can do anything I like with a jury
in Westchester County; I know and have known for
twenty years almost every man within forty miles; but
we shall have to go out into the highways and byways
for talesmen: your case has attracted almost universal
attention. It is just possible, therefore, that the
jury may convict you—Don’t be frightened—Don’t
look like that—please!—If that happens I shall take
the case to the General Term, and failing that, to the
Court of Appeals. One way or another I shall get
you off—I pledge you my life on that,” he added
vehemently. “Will you put your faith in me and keep
up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure no woman could help it,” said Patience,
smiling graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, somewhat to her amusement, she thought
on Bourke with a certain sweet tremor until she fell
asleep. She did not yet love him, but he satisfied her
imagination; and he was the first man that ever had.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was rehearsed eight or ten times, Mr. Simms
cross-examining by a different method upon each occasion,
racking his brain for new points with which to
confound her. She began to feel quite at ease on the
witness stand, and equal to the coming tilt with the
district attorney. Aside from a natural nervousness
she felt no fear of the approaching crisis, rather an
excited interest. The papers were booming her again,
and she would have been less than American had she
not appreciated her position as heroine of the most
sensational drama of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last week of February, however, she received
information which induced her first misgiving: Miss
Beale was down with pneumonia. That superlatively
healthy person loved fresh air only less than she loved
the Lord, and slept with her windows open in mid-winter.
Despite habit she invariably caught cold when travelling,
as the one window of a small sleeping-room was likely
to be at the head of her bed. She had defied Nature
once too often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patience told Mr. Bourke of Miss Beale’s illness,
the red streaked his face, as it had a habit of
doing when he was disturbed. They were alone in the
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it make much difference?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I hope not; only she would have been a
great card. She is known and respected throughout
the county, and I should have dinned her in the ears
of the jury. But you should have some woman with
you. Is there no one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience shook her head. “No one that would be
of use. I have few women friends. Women don’t like
me much, I think. Mrs. Burr was my most intimate
friend, but her husband naturally wanted to keep her
out of the affair, and sent her off to Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is odd. I cannot think of you as friendless. You
attract and antagonise more strongly than any one I
ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was staring hard at her, and she turned her head
away, colouring slightly. It was the first time they had
been alone since the initial rehearsal, although he and
the other lawyers had often lingered, after business was
over, to talk with her. Apparently she and he were
the best of friends, and their former acquaintance had
not been recognised by a glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if we really are friends,” he said abruptly,
then shook his shoulders slightly, as if, having made
the plunge, he would not retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience beat her fingers lightly on the desk, but did
not turn her face to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our relationship is very agreeable,” she said coolly.
“I am delighted that Mr. Simms, for instance, is not
my counsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s suggestive silence, and then
he said: “I understand. I can be nothing but counsel
to you until I apologise. I have not done so before
because there is no excuse to offer. I can only explain:
you had deceived and outwitted and made a fool of
me, and I was furious. Moreover, I was horribly disappointed.
I am perfectly well aware that all that is
no excuse. I was bitterly ashamed afterwards, and far
more furious with myself than I had been with you. I
have never ceased to deplore it. We might at least
have been friends—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you forgave me then?” asked Patience, looking
at his flushed face with a smile. He had never looked
more awkward nor more attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; my offence was so much worse, you see,
I had to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, giving him her hand gracefully, “we
will forgive each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accepted her hand promptly and evinced no
disposition to relinquish it. “You are so cold, though,”
he said ruefully. “Your forgiveness is merely indifference.
But of course,” hastily, “you are absorbed in
much weightier matters than friendship. I can imagine
how insignificant all other episodes of your past must
seem—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if it were not for you I might have been here
before to-day, and in a much worse predicament. I
doubt if I should have left him as soon as I did if it
had not been for your unpleasant truths. I was drifting,
and also drifting toward morbidity, where I might
have been capable of anything. If I had really killed
him and been arrested I should have said so, and even
you could not have saved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it would have been easier: I could have got
you off on the plea of insanity. But am I really a link
in the chain? I am egoistical—and interested—enough
to be—pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” she said, laughing a little. “You have
had a good deal more to do with forging some of the
links than you imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand was beginning to tremble, and she withdrew
her own. He did not attempt to recapture it, and for
a moment they regarded each other defensively. He
had avoided the mistake of mistakes for thirty-six years,
and the very flavour of romance about his experience
with this woman made him wary. She had been
mistaken twice and had ordered her imagination to
sleep. Something within him pulled her, but none
knew better than she the independent activity of sex.
Still, like all women, fire was dear to her fingers. His
eyes had a gleam in them which made her experience
keenly the pleasurable sensation of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know that night that I had forgotten our
conversation in the tower?” he said, laughing uneasily.
“Well, I will admit that I had, but I certainly remember
the conversation in the elm walk—every word of it.
It was a singular conversation,” he continued hurriedly.
“I have not found her yet, by the way. What is love,
anyhow? Something always seems to be lacking. I
have wanted a good many women, but there were
shallows somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had taken a chair and was fanning herself
slowly. She answered with a judicial air, as of one
deciding some abstract point to which she had given
exhaustive study: “The lack is spiritual emotion.
People of strong natures who are really in love are
shaken by a passion that for the time being demands
no physical expression. It is only when it subsides, in
fact, that the other manifests itself. On the other hand,
the unimpassioned, the physically meagre, are incapable
of even imagining such an exaltation of emotion. It
is the supreme convulsion of mystery. And it must be
impossible to feel it more than once in a lifetime—for
more than one person, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever felt it?” he asked abruptly. He
was sitting opposite her, his brows drawn together,
regarding her intently. Her cool impersonality nonplussed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the organ. If one wants to read the riddle of
human nature let him listen to the organ for ten minutes.
It lashes the soul—the emotional nature—up
to its utmost possibilities. One knows instinctively—that
is, if one is given to reasoning at all; for instincts
are dead letters without analysis—that only one other
force can cause a mightier tumult, a greater exaltation.
Those that do not reason mistake it for a desire to
spread their wings and fly to the throne of grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke set his lips and looked at the floor. “Of
course you are right,” he said. “A man would never
know that until he had felt it. It takes a woman to
divine it. Perhaps it is as well he doesn’t know it—there
is one disappointment the less in life if such
moments never come to him; and I doubt if they come
to many. Either the savage is too strong in most of
us, or we never come within range of the responsive
spark. I have held that if there is any meaning at all
in the progress of man out of barbarism it is that he
shall become a brain with a refinement and intensity of
passion which shall give happiness without disgust.
But you go beyond me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we are both right,” said Patience, rising. “We
are much better off than our ancestors. I like so
much to talk to you. When I am free you must come
to see me often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall, indeed. How gracefully you fan yourself.
I never saw any one use the fan in exactly the same
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I learned how from the old Spanish women in
Monterey. They hold the thumb outwards, you know.
That makes all the difference in the world. <span class='it'>Au
revoir.</span>”</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The trial began on the eighth of March. Patience
slept ill the night before, and arose early. She looked
forward to the day’s ordeal with mingled nervousness
and curiosity. Her faith in Bourke was complete, and
her mind was of the order that craves experience. She
could not divest herself of the idea that she was about
to play the part of heroine in a great human drama.
And assuredly there has been no such theatre as the
court room since the world began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dressed herself with extreme care, in a tailor
frock and toque of black and white. The costume was
becoming, but she shook her head at her reflection in
the mirror: hers was not the type of beauty to appeal
to the class of men in whose hands her life would be;
rather they would resent its cold pride, its manifest of
race and civilisation. She remembered her youthful
satisfaction in the fact that “common men did not like
her.” Rosita or Honora would carry a jury by storm,
but she was too subtle to appeal to men outside of her
own social sphere. Tarbox liked her because she was
game and dependent on him for comfort: it was doubtful
if he thought her pretty. He came up at ten minutes
to ten. He wore a new suit of clothes, and looked
excited and impatient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot of swells come,” he said without preliminary;
“some from New York and some from the
county. We’ve got ’em up in the gallery, and they
look fine in their new spring clothes, I tell you. First
time I ever seen swells in this court house. I rather
thought they didn’t go in for that kind of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They go in for fads, and you can as easily tell
where lightning will strike next as what will be the
next fad to possess fashionable women. Where is
Mr. Bourke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up in the court room, I guess. Ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later he led her up the stair at the
back of the court room. A crowd of men at the door
parted to let her enter, staring at her with eager curiosity.
As she walked down the room to her seat beside
her counsel she was conscious of a deep level of men’s
faces below and a tier of high-bred faces and bright
spring gowns in the gallery above. She felt as if she
were being shot upon a battery of eyes, and an impulse
to turn and run; she looked like a black and white
effigy of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The large handsome room was tinted a pale blue
and stencilled about the mouldings. The Bench and
panelling behind it, the desks and tables, were of black
walnut. Four long windows on each side of the room
revealed the naked trees of March and the cheerless
landscape. On the right of Patience’s chair was the
empty jury box, before her the Bench. In the space
thus formed—flanked on the other side by the talesmen
summoned for the trial and at the back by the
audience—was a right angle of long study tables, three
or four round tables, and many chairs. Every chair was
occupied. Writing pads lay on the smaller tables.
Patience recognised several of the reporters. By one
of the long tables before the jury box sat Bourke,
Simms, and Lansing. The former whispered to her
that many of the men within the rail were eminent
lawyers who had come to hear the case tried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge sat alone on the Bench: an old man with
pink face and head and neck, a close band of silver hair
at the base of his skull. His face was narrow, his upper
lip long. On either side of his mouth was a deep rut.
The nose was coarse and strong, the eyes behind the
spectacles humourous, severe, and a little sly. His
silver chin-tuft was shaped like the queen of hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just below the Bench, beside one of the long tables,
sat a man whom Patience did not notice at once, but to
whom, as the judge called the court to order, she
turned suddenly, conscious of a fixed gaze. He sat
with one arm along the table, the other hand absently
rolling a piece of paper. His narrowed eyes were regarding
her with cold speculation. Patience shuddered.
She knew that he was Sturges, the district attorney.
Tarbox had told and retold the history of his jealousy
of Bourke, and his registered vow to win one of the
great legal battles of which they were occasionally chief
combatants. And this was the greatest! The man’s
face was set. He looked like a fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk called a name. A man shuffled into the
jury box. Sturges stood up and put the usual questions.
He spoke with exaggerated courtesy. Occasionally he
smiled: a mechanical smile, as if an invisible string
connected each corner of his mouth with a manipulator
at the back of his head. His voice was soothing and
cultivated, his manner almost deferential to the humble
man in the box. Patience followed every motion and
word with fascinated attention. When he asked the
talesman if he had “any conscientious scruples regarding
capital punishment as practised in this State,” she
felt the touch of icy fingers and her feet slipping into
an open grave. Bourke, who divined her sensations,
smiled encouragingly; and after she had heard
the question some fifty times, she ceased to attach any
personal meaning to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were four days impannelling the jury. The first
time Patience stood up to face an accepted juror she
regarded the hairy and ill-kept farmer with such
haughty and disdainful eyes that Bourke whispered
hurriedly: “For God’s sake don’t look at them like
that or they’ll send you up out of spite. Remember
that this class of people is always at war with its
betters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it,” said Patience. “It’s humiliating
to think of being at the mercy of men like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the box was filled at last she regarded the
occupants attentively. They were hard-featured men
of middle age, with long bare upper lip and compressed
mouth. Their grey skin was furrowed with lines of
care and hardship, their chin whiskers grizzled and
scant. Their eyebrows stood out over faded eyes in
wrinkled sockets. But what excited Patience’s wonder
was the small size of the heads. She had never seen
twelve heads so little. They were hardly an advance
upon their hairy ancestors. Throughout the trial she
furtively watched the twelve faces of those twelve
meagre heads. Never once did their expression,
stolid and set, change. At night they haunted her.
She awoke in the morning with a violent start, seeing
them for a moment in a row on the foot board of her
bed. She speculated, at times, upon the lives of those
men, those pinched grubbing lives, and felt for them a
sort of terrified pity. What a mere glimpse of the
world she had had, after all, and what ugly strata it
had! What was the matter with civilisation?</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth day the district attorney opened the
case with an address to the jury which was a masterpiece
of temperate statement and damning suggestion.
He dwelt long upon the remarkable points of the case:
the youth and beauty and intelligence and social
position of the defendant, the distinguished family
which had been plunged into sorrow and disgrace
by her crime, the extraordinary interest the crime
had excited throughout the civilised world. He then
gave a running account, clear and straightforward and
decisive, of what the prosecution would prove, and concluded
with a cold, terse, but reiterated warning that the
prisoner at the bar was entitled to no sympathy because
of her sex and position; that he and the jury were
there for one purpose only: to consider the facts of
the case and to do their plain duty, utterly regardless
of consequences to the individual. Every word was
chosen and weighed, and told like the ring of a steel
hammer on a steel plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lewis was then called to prove the fact of
Beverly Peele’s death, and his vigorous story weighed
heavily in the scales against the defence. The
moment the district attorney sat down Bourke was on
his feet. For a moment he stood lifting and shaking
the loose cloth of the table beside him; then asked one
or two random questions which put the witness for the
prosecution quite at his ease. In the course of a
moment the witness began to writhe, and at the end of
five minutes manifested his consciousness of the fact
that he was a small country practitioner, to be regarded
by any intelligent jury with contempt. Nevertheless,
it was impossible to shake his testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was followed by the New York physician, a man
of eminence, who had assisted at the death-bed, then
by the coroner. The fact of young Peele’s death being
firmly established in the jury box, a chemist was put
upon the stand to testify that he had found morphine
in the stomach of the deceased. He was worried and
badgered and ridiculed and derided by Bourke, who
temporarily infected everybody in the court room
with his scorn of the exercise of chemistry as applied
to morphine in the stomach of a dead man, but held
his ground, having been maltreated in a like manner
many times before. Following, came a civil engineer,
who described the grounds and general position of
Peele Manor to the jury; and the testimony for the
day was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning the prosecution passed on to the
motive. Honora was the first witness called. She wore
a black frock and hat, and looked dignified and sad.
In her clear childlike voice she described to the jury
her moment of confusion and horror when awakened
from a profound sleep by the prisoner; told the mournful
story of the unavailing attempts at resuscitation;
and hesitatingly admitted, in full detail, the unmistakable
indifference of the wife. To the latter testimony
Mr. Bourke “objected,” as he had done to similar
testimony by the doctors, but the objection was over-ruled
by the judge. She also admitted having seen
from her window the defendant returning from town
after her early visit on the morning of the “Eye”
story, inappropriately attired in grey and pink, and
having discovered the newspapers in confusion on the
library floor before any other member of the household
except the prisoner had arisen. She related Patience’s
previous complaint that her husband always waited
until she was in her first heavy sleep before demanding
the morphine, and her fear lest she should some night
give him an overdose. The jury must have been small
headed indeed, to fail to understand the district
attorney’s insinuations regarding the prisoner’s deep-laid
scheme to avert suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Honora gave her testimony Patience saw Mr.
Bourke’s eyes sparkle. She knew that some pregnant
idea had flashed into that lightning-like brain. As the
district attorney took his seat he rose slowly and
smiled sociably at Honora. She bent her head slightly;
she had always liked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Mairs,” he said haltingly, his eyes wandering
to the judge, as if in search of inspiration, his hand
flirting the loose cloth of the table, “you are sure
that Mrs. Peele wore a gray gown to New York that
morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the condition of the newspapers seemed to
you to indicate great agitation of mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. And she returned in an hour or two,
you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Mairs!” he thundered, turning suddenly upon
her and pointing a rigid finger straight at her startled
face, “are you sure that you were asleep when Mrs.
Peele awakened you on the night of Beverly Peele’s
death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience drew her breath sharply. She closed her
eyes. Honora had not been asleep that night! The
certainty came to her as suddenly and as positively as
it had come to Bourke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the fraction of a moment Honora hesitated.
Every man and woman in the court room was breathless.
Several had started to their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure,” she replied finally, and that silver
shallow voice did not falter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are <span class='it'>sure</span> that you heard no one go to the
lavatory that night, before Mrs. Peele spoke to you?”
He hurled the words at her as the Great Judge might
hurl the final sentence on Judgment Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was your door open that night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience leaned over and whispered to Lansing, who
sprang forward and whispered to Bourke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night was hot,” continued Bourke. “Were
you not in the habit of leaving your door open on hot
nights?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it not always your custom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always. When I thought of it I opened the
door, but I frequently forgot it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Yes! You are quite sure you cannot remember
whether or not it was open on that night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember any other nights on which Mrs.
Peele went to the lavatory to drop the morphine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; a great many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of this all important night you remember
nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Mrs. Peele never was called upon to drop
the morphine until after twelve o’clock. Were you in
the habit of lying awake until late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But on this night you went to sleep early?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard or saw—you are on your oath, remember—nothing
whatever until Mrs. Peele called
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can go.—She is lying,” he whispered to
Patience. “Damn her, I’ll make her speak yet if I
have to throttle it out of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele was the witness next called. He was
treated with extreme diffidence by the district attorney,
and even the judge gave him a fraternal smile.
He told the story of the momentous night with parental
indignation finally controlled, then, in spite of
repeated “objections” and constant nagging, the
significant tale of wifely indifference and desertion,
and read to the jury “that cruel letter written to a
dying man” the day before the defendant returned
to nurse her husband. He repeated with the dramatic
effect of the legal actor those dark insinuations
of the prisoner: “You had better let me go!
I feel that I shall kill him if I stay!” And later
in the town house when she had struck her husband
in the face: “You had better keep him out of my
way. Do you know that once I tried to kill my own
mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told of her eager interest in untraceable poisons
one night when the subject of murder had come up at
the dinner-table, her cold-blooded analysis of human
motives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he passed on to the painfully significant history
of the day before the death: her demand for a
divorce; her fury at her husband’s refusal; her acknowledgment
that she had quarrelled violently with the
deceased a short time before calling the family to his
death-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke Patience’s blood congealed. The woman
he depicted was enough to inspire any jury with
horror. It was herself and not herself, a Galatea manufactured
by a clever lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was Mr. Bourke’s privilege to give the Galatea
a soul. Despite the older man’s greater legal experience,
his superior wariness and subtlety, he was forced
to admit that his son was a fool; that his son’s wife was
a woman of brilliant intellect driven to desperation at
being tied down to a fool; that so long as she had lived
with him she had done her duty; that when she had
returned as his nurse she had fulfilled her part of the
contract to the letter; that never had she given her
husband cause for real jealousy; that the witness himself
had made a companion of her, and that he had
been bitterly disappointed in his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terrible facts could not be stricken out, but Mr.
Peele, nevertheless, was made to pass the most uncomfortable
hours of his life. “And in spite of these
threats,” exclaimed Bourke, with the accentuation of
one addressing an idiot at large, “in spite of the precision
with which you remembered them, you permitted
your family to implore her to return and become your
son’s nurse; you permitted her to sleep in a room communicating
with his, where, in a fit of passion—if she
is the woman you profess to believe her to be—she
could have murdered him in the dead of night with a
carving knife or a hatchet, before any one—even the
lightly sleeping Miss Mairs—could have flown to the
rescue; you permitted her—” he turned suddenly
and faced the jury, then wheeled about and regarded
Mr. Peele with scornful inquiry—“you permitted her
to drop morphine for your son, and to have unrestrained
access to the drug, knowing that he in his agony would
swallow whatever she gave him without question. Will
you kindly explain to the jury whether this mode of
proceeding was ingenuousness on your part, or criminal
connivance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Peele’s under lip pressed the upper almost to
the septum of his nose. His eyes half closed and
glittered unpleasantly; but he controlled himself and
answered,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I paid no attention to her threats at the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You did not believe in them? You admit
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I classed them with the usual hysterical ravings of
women. That was my error.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“State, if you please, your specific reasons for your
change of mind. You will hardly, as a lawyer, claim to
have been converted to the defendant’s capacity for
crime by the mere fact that your son died of an overdose
of morphine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And throughout the long day Mr. Bourke hectored
him, fighting him, point by point, smashing to bits his
testimony relative to the events of the day preceding
the death, evidence to which he was not an eye-witness,
which he had received at second hand from his wife
and son. The “cruel letter written to a dying man”
was disposed of in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You believed your son to be in a precarious condition
when you counselled them to send for your son’s
wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you believed with the doctors that if she returned,
thereby bringing him peace of mind as well as
tender care, he had excellent chances for life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Burr was instructed to present that phase
of the question to the defendant, with all the force of
which she was capable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the defendant so understood it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet you assert that this purely business-like
letter, written by a self-respecting woman, was addressed
to a dying man, while at the same time you
assert that this man could be cured by the gratification
of a whim, and that you had taken particular pains to
make the defendant aware of the fact!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Peele finally left the stand, he looked
battered and limp.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the court had opened on the following
morning, Mrs. Peele was called. She looked haughtily
askance at the worn Bible as the clerk rattled off the
oath, bent her head as would she whiff upon what
plebeian lips had touched so often and so evidently,
and took the witness chair as were she mounting a
throne. She was apparelled in crape. Only her intimate
friends could have told whether the backward
bend of her head was due to the weight of her veil or
the weight of her ancestors. At first she stared at the
district attorney with haughty resentment, as, for the
benefit of the humble jury, he curtly asked her several
direct questions; but remembering that he was “a
Sturges,” and also recalling her husband’s admonitions,
she unbent, and even condescended to address the jury.
Her tale of the night in no wise differed from her husband’s;
but her accentuation of Patience’s dark threats
and marital deficiencies was all her own. Her suggestion
of a lover in the case caused a sudden movement
in the jury box, although the stolid faces did not relax.
Under cross-examination much of her testimony was as
effectually demolished as her husband’s had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two maid servants followed. They testified to violent
quarrels between the young couple. Then the
butler testified to the reiterant and emphatic command
of the prisoner on the day before the death to send to
New York for morphine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution produced its trump card: the stable
boy who had spied upon the interviews between the
prisoner and the mysterious lover. The man had evidently
been carefully rehearsed—as Bourke later on
pointed out to the jury—for his memory of the eight
or ten interviews he had witnessed needed little refreshing.
His “best recollection” was given glibly and
ungrammatically. He dilated upon the young man’s
remarkable personal beauty, and observed that it far
outshone his beloved Mr. Beverly’s. They had talked
principally of books in all but the last two interviews,
but had looked perfectly happy. His account of the last
two interviews created a profound impression in the
court room, even the jury leaning forward slightly.
The judge frowned and wheeled his chair sharply when
the man gave the gist of the prisoner’s matter-of-fact
objection to living with a man who was not her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bourke’s rich voice had never rung with deeper
indignation and disgust, never shaped itself to more
cutting sarcasm than when he made the man see himself
and the jury see him as a coward, a cur, a spy, a
liar, an eager schemer for an innocent woman’s life.
“You felt it your duty,” he concluded, “to spy upon a
woman of irreproachable reputation who met a friend
in an open wood in broad daylight—Yes, yes,” with all
the lingering scornful emphasis which only he could give
that simple word. “You never felt yourself a cowardly
scoundrel meddling in what was none of your business—No!
No!” He turned to the jury with the passion
still upon his face, but when he took his seat he smiled
encouragingly to his admiring young client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t he make an actor?” whispered Simms.
“I never saw him do the lofty indignation act with
finer effect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he would be a great actor, at least,” retorted
Patience, “and I am convinced that you would be a
very small one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just wait,” said Simms, angrily. “I’ve got to talk
to this jury about you in a day or two, and if you don’t
forget I ever doubted you I’ll eat my hat. The best
lawyer’s the best fakir, and a few days from now you’ll
see what an ambitious man I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Rosita Thrailkill,” called the district attorney
when the court opened next morning. The audience
stood up to a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A plump willowy Spanish figure undulated behind
the jury box, kissed the Bible reverently, and ascended
the witness stand. Rosita was clad in black and yellow,
a mantilla in place of a hat, and many diamonds.
She looked as pretty and as naughty as possible. As
she met Patience’s eyes, she wafted her a kiss, and the
prisoner groaned in spirit. She gave her name and
birthplace with melodious caressing accent and her
marked precision of speech. Yes, the defendant had
been her dear friend, her best friend, her only intimate
friend. Yes, with unaffected reluctance, Mrs. Sparhawk
had been disreputable, and Patience had once
attempted her life. Yes, she was the prima donna of
light opera known as La Rosita. Did she appear before
the public in tights and scant attire? Yes, why
not? Had she not had a number of lovers? Objected
to and sustained. Flashing indignation of soft Spanish
eyes. Did she not have the reputation of being a
woman of loose and lawless life? Objected to and sustained.
Angry rattle of fan. Was it not in her house
that the prisoner was arrested? Yes, it was! and she
loved her Patita and would always give her shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the district attorney sat down with an ugly
smile on his thin mouth, Bourke, muttering anathema,
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there ever a whisper against your reputation
when you were a school-girl in Monterey and most
intimate with the prisoner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, <span class='it'>señor</span>!” cried Rosita, paying no attention to
the objection. “I was a child, and could not even
endure boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many times have you seen the defendant
since you left Monterey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosita cast up her eyes, then tapped the sticks of her
fan successively as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once she came to see me just after—ah—WCTU
died; then once just before she left Mr. Peele; then
that day the ‘Eye’ came out and said she had done this
so horrible thing. <span class='it'>Ay, dios!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has called upon you three times only, then,
since you were children in Monterey, since you have
been the Rosita of the public; in the last five years,
in short?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señor</span>—yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long did she remain upon her first visit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, only a little while. I told her something that
shocked her, for she was always so proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you tell her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Objected to,” cried the district attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Objection sustained,” snapped the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long did she remain on her second visit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a half hour. I never knew what she came
at all for. She just floated in and out.” Rosita waved
her arm with enchanting grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she tell you why she came the third time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she had no other place to go to. She said
no hotel would take her in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said that her old landlady had refused to
admit her, did she not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señor.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!—and that in her terrible extremity
she naturally turned to the friend of her childhood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si!</span>” and Rosita wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that she should not have gone to your house if
there had been any possibility of obtaining entrance to
a hotel, or if she had not been turned out of her
father-in-law’s house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ay, yi!</span> yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all. You can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the rest of that day and the two following
days the experts for the prosecution had the stand.
The innumerable questions asked by the district
attorney, the technical details of the cross-examinations,
the constant interruptions, and the minutiæ
of the evidence emptied the court room after the first
hour, and even Patience became bored, and fell to
thinking of other things, not forgetting to pity those
twelve puzzled little heads in the jury box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gist of the evidence was that there was enough
morphine in Beverly Peele’s stomach to kill two men.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Our turn has come,” said Lansing to Patience on the
morning after the expert testimony was concluded.
“We are confident of success now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the facts are hideous, and they have painted
me black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Bourke scraped off a good deal, and he’ll have
the rest off before he gets through. If he could only
make that lying woman open her mouth! You’ve borne
yourself splendidly. Keep in good condition for the
witness stand. Are you frightened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, smiling at Bourke gratefully. “Not
a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simms opened the case for the defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a harsh strident voice. He gesticulated as if
practising for a prize fight, doubling back and springing
forward. He cleared his throat with vicious
emphasis and rasped his heels upon the floor. His
statements were dry and matter-of-fact, his language
bald; but he made a direct vigorous and enthusiastic
speech. The jury was informed that it was there to
save the life of one of the most brilliant and high-minded
young women of the age,—a woman utterly incapable
of murder or of any violent act, a woman with the mild
and meditative mind of the student. That it would be
proved not only that she was far too clever to take life
by such clumsy methods, but that she had no object,
as she had gained her liberty, and the lover was a myth.
The whole prosecution was a malignant and personal
prosecution of an innocent but too gifted woman by
an absurdly conceited family that had resented her
superior intelligence. This and much more of fact and
fancy. But Patience, with perverse feminity, liked
him none the better, and would not even look at him
when he sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Field was the first witness for the defence.
Although compelled under cross-examination to admit
the prisoner’s interest in subtle poisons, he managed to
convey to the jury that it was merely the result of an
unusually brilliant and inquiring mind, a thought born
of the moment, of his suggestion. He gave the highest
tribute to her cleverness, her work on his paper, and
to her reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Latimer Burr was called next, and spoke with enthusiasm
of her “unfailing submission to a man of abominable
and savage temper until submission ceased to be
a virtue.” He had never heard her utter any threats
to kill. Yes, it was true that he had engaged counsel
for defence. He believed in her thoroughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Merrien, her landlady, and Mrs. Blair were put
on the stand next morning, and the good character
they gave Patience was unshaken by the nagging of the
district attorney. Mr. Tarbox testified to her demeanour
of innocence during her imprisonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the defence is weak all the same,” whispered
Patience to Lansing. “Not a word can be said in
rebuttal. Only Mr. Bourke’s eloquence can save
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good character goes a long way,” replied Lansing.
“You have no idea of its weight with a jury, particularly
with a jury of this kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was put on the witness stand next. The
supreme effort to overcome nervousness gave her an icy
and repellent demeanour. Never had she held her back
as erect, her head as high. She kept her eyelids half
lowered, and spoke with scarcely any change of inflection.
She told the story of the night as she had told
it in rehearsal many times. There had been a quarrel
an hour before she heard the deceased get up and go
to the lavatory. She offered to drop his morphine, and
he replied with an oath that she should never do
another thing for him as long as he lived, that he
hoped she would leave the house by the first train next
morning. His sudden silence upon his return to his bed
excited her apprehension, and she called the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bourke sat down and the district attorney
arose and confronted her she shivered suddenly.
Bourke’s rich strong voice and kind magnetic gaze had
given her courage, but this man with his eyes like grey
ice, his mechanical smile, and cold smooth voice conjured
up a sudden awful picture of the execution room
at Sing Sing. Her insight appreciated with exactitude
the pitiless ambition of the man, knew that he stood
pledged to his future to send her to her death. He
made her admit all the damning facts of the evidence
against her, the facts which stood out like phosphorescent
letters on a black wall, and to acknowledge her
abhorrence of the man that had been her husband. But
all this had been anticipated: at least he could not
confuse her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again two days and a part of a third were monopolised
by experts. These two illustrious chemists testified,
through the same bewildering mass of detail as
that employed by their equally illustrious predecessors,
that there was not enough morphine in Beverly Peele’s
stomach to kill a cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short interval, after the second expert
had been permitted to leave the stand, during which
Bourke and Simms and Lansing conferred together,
preparatory to the summing up of the former. As
Bourke was about to rise, the district attorney stood
up, cleared his throat, and said: “One moment, please.
Will Miss Honora Mairs kindly take the stand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke was on the alert in an instant. “The case
for the prosecution has closed,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is by special permission of the Court,” replied
the district attorney, coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Honora ascended the stand there was a deep
murmur of admiration. She looked like an angel,
nothing less. She wore a white lawn frock, girt with a
blue sash; a large white leghorn lined with azure velvet,
against which the baby gold of her hair shone softly.
Her great blue eyes had the clear calm serenity of a
young child. Patience drew her breath in a series of
short gasps. Bourke sat with clenched hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We understand,” said the district attorney, severely,
“that you did not tell all you knew the other day, and
that you have signified your willingness to now tell the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Is
this true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora bowed her head with an expression of deep
humility, as a child might that had been justly
rebuked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had not slept at all upon that fatal night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your door was open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did see somebody enter the lavatory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom did you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s breathless silence, during
which Patience wondered if a clock had ever ticked so
loudly, or if the sun had ever shone with so vicious
a glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom did you see?” repeated the district attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She dropped some thirty or forty drops of morphine,
I should say, then half filled the glass with water,
as usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did not see the deceased go to the lavatory
that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor any one else until the defendant called you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bourke sprang to his feet, his nostrils dilating,
his fine face quivering with unassumed scorn and
indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You admit that you perjured yourself the other
day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not make up my mind to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind what you had not made up your mind
to do. You admit that you perjured yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That in other words you lied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.” Her voice was like the quiver of a violin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What proof are we to have that you are not lying
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not lying. My conscience gave me no rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will give you more, I suppose, if you will have
succeeded in swearing away the life of an innocent
woman. Yes, yes!—Exactly how long did Mrs. Peele
remain in the lavatory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot remember. Five or ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“State the exact time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a few moments later when she ran into your
room you pretended to be asleep: Why did you assume
sleep; what reason had you for lying at that time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had dropped off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had been sufficiently wide awake five minutes
before to note precisely all these other things, and then
had promptly fallen into a sound sleep. Is that your
usual habit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you speak to the prisoner when she came into
the lavatory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were not you in the habit of holding a conversation
with her upon such occasions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you not address her on that night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was very sleepy, and had nothing in particular to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you were not too sleepy to note carefully all
the details in the evidence you have just given. You
can go,—and to the devil,” he muttered. He thrust
his hands into his pockets and wheeled about, looking
at Patience with such intensity of gaze that she moved
suddenly forward. Her face was pale, but her eyes
blazed with rage. Bourke glanced at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is twenty minutes to one,” he said. “I would
ask your honour to adjourn until two. I must have
time to digest this new testimony. Its remarkable
glibness prevented me from giving it the running deliberation
that it demanded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge sulkily dismissed the court. As Patience
passed out of the room with Tarbox she heard the
word “angel” more than once, and knew that it did
not refer to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience was not conscious of fear as she ate her
luncheon. Her heart was black with rage. “I’d willingly
murder <span class='it'>her</span>,” she thought, “and my conscience
wouldn’t trouble me the least little bit.”</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after recess Mr. Bourke began his summing
up. He commenced quietly, shaking the loose
cloth of the table in an absent manner. His language
was colloquial as he spoke to the jury of its grave
responsibilities, and complimented it upon the “unusual
intelligence which it had so far made evident.” He
passed naturally to the subject in hand, and dwelt eloquently
upon the character of the defendant, of her
lonely pathetic youth, her high ideals, her remarkable
intelligence, her ignorance of the world which had led
her to fall in love with the first handsome and attractive
man that had addressed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice rose to tragic pitch as he dwelt upon the
terrible awakening of such a woman, bound for life to
such a man,—a sensual, ill-tempered, selfish brute,
who was a disgrace to the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He depicted two years of uncomplaining wifely devotion
(until Patience became lost in admiration of the
defendant), the husband’s frantic rages about nothing,
his unrecognition of her superiority, his ignorant determination
to make her his slave—his plaything—she,
a woman whom such men as James E. Field and Gardiner
Peele delighted to honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he dropped again into pathos (which never for
a moment degenerated into bathos) and described the
desolate life of such a woman in an empty frivolous brainless
society (faint murmur and indignant rustle in the
gallery), a society of idle people with neither soul nor
intelligence, but who squandered the money wrested
from the People, the great People, of whom the Gentlemen
of the Jury were twelve worthy and doubtless long
suffering members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until he had emphasised and recapitulated
with every resource of his splendid vocabulary, every
modulation of his glorious voice, by controlled and telling
gesture, by sudden tremendous bursts of indignation,
the married life of the prisoner, that he passed to
the day and night of the tragedy. He began with the
morning, and dwelt upon every detail of the day. Before
he reached midnight he had Beverly Peele in a
frame of mind for both suicide and murder. He sent
him to bed with black skin and white flecked nose and
chaos in his heart. With a magnificent burst of scorn
he quoted his shameful language when his wife had
offered to get him the morphine, the oaths he had
used to a “refined and elegant and patient woman.”
Then he took him to the lavatory, showed him jerking
the stopper from the morphine bottle, and recklessly
pouring a fourth of its contents into a glass. “He
knew that he had to die anyhow, and he could at least
die happy in a hideous revenge.” In brief and vivid
phrase he cited several similar instances in legal
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he returned to Peele Manor and denounced the
jealous woman who for five years had nursed fury in
her heart, and who, on the witness stand, here, Gentlemen
of the Jury, conceived, at the unfortunate suggestion
of the speaker, the frightful revenge upon a woman
who had treated her with unvarying kindness. She
did not speak at once, partly because her lying tale
needed rehearsing, partly because she believed that the
case for the prosecution would win without her. But
when she saw that the case for the prosecution was
wholly lost she arrayed herself like an angel, that she
might the better impose upon the unworldly Gentlemen
of the Jury, and swore away a woman’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The several assertions on the defendant’s part that
she felt disposition to murder he tore to rags and flung
in the face of the jury. Had not every high tempered
person—could not the Gentlemen of the Jury recall
having exclaimed in bitter moments: “I wish you
were dead! I could kill you!” With deep regret
and remorse he would confess that he had used similar
expressions many times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with consummate skill he dilated upon the impossibility
of so clever a woman as the defendant
doing aught so stupid as to murder in the manner of
the accusation. When there was nothing left to say
on this subject he expatiated upon the lack of motive
with a technical and personal brilliancy which made
even the cross-grained old judge lean forward with a
cynical smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interviews, even the final ones, with the mysterious
stranger, he treated with contempt, although the
contempt was sufficiently long drawn out to impress
the jury with every most insignificant detail. It, was
the mere longing for companionship of a lonely woman:
that was the beginning and the end of it. The lover,
the intention of either to marry, he disposed of with a
vehemence which made Simms twist about suddenly
and look at Lansing; but the young man was regarding
his chief with rapt admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so much as the scraping of a boot heel was heard
in the court room. Patience glanced at the district
attorney. His face was set and sullen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After every possible point had been considered
Bourke concluded with an appeal so stirring, so ringing,
so thrilling that every person in the court room
except the district attorney sat forward and held his
breath. No such burst of passion had ever been heard
in that room before. Patience covered her face with
her hands. Her heart beat suffocatingly. The blood
pounded in her ears; but not one note of that wonderful
voice, not one phrase of fire, escaped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there any possible condition in which a man can
appear to such supreme advantage as when pleading
for the life of a fellow being, more particularly of a
young and beautiful woman? How paltry all the time-worn
rescues of woman from sinking ship and runaway
horse and burning house. A great criminal lawyer
standing before the jury box with a life in his hand has
the unique opportunity to display all the best gifts ever
bestowed upon man: genius, brain, passion, heart,
soul, eloquence, a figure instinct with grace and virility,
a face blazing with determination to snatch a man or
woman from the most awful of dooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all in two short hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If those in the court room for whom the case had no
personal interest were at Bourke’s feet, hanging upon
his words, adoring him for the moment, what were the
feelings of the woman for whom he was making so desperate
and manly a fight? She forgot her danger, forgot
everything but the man, the reckless joy of loving, of
being swept out of her calm orbit at last. Her analytical
brain was dulled, her arms ached, her heart shook her
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Bourke made a few supplementary remarks calculated
to take the wind out of the district attorney’s
sails,—references to the young man’s ambition, his
youthful eagerness to become famous, what the winning
of such a great case would mean to him, and to his
remarkable cleverness and skill with a jury,—Patience
heard Simms say to Lansing: “My God! Bourke has
surpassed even himself. Even he never got as high as
that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the greatest man in the country, God bless
him!” said Lansing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Bourke finally dropped upon his chair he turned
to Patience. Their eyes met and lingered; and in
that moment each passed into the other’s keeping.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Sturges lost no time taking his stand before the jury
box. It was the hour of his life, but he was not nervous.
His long thin figure leaning toward the box as
he rested his finger tips on the table, showed as fine
a repose of nerve as of brain. His clear-cut face
with the cruel mouth and pleasant smile was calm
and unclouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began by defending himself against Mr. Bourke’s
remarks, and asserted with convincing emphasis that
when he had taken the oath of office he had left his
personal ambition behind him with his personal interests,
and had given himself body and soul and brain
to the People of Westchester County. Then he made
an equally earnest statement of the grave responsibilities
of a district attorney, his solemn duty to the People,
the necessity to smother all promptings of humanity
that he might do what was best for the People—“The
greatest good of the greatest number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he painted Patience as black as Bourke had
enamelled her white. With masterly ingenuity he
made each juror feel what an awful being a bad woman
was, an unloving undutiful wife; what a curse each
man of them would writhe under had Fate played him
as scurvy a trick as it had played poor Beverly Peele;
that no unloved husband’s life would be safe were not
such women exploited and punished, that if the
Gentlemen of the Jury were weak enough to consider
her sex they might be imperilling the lives of countless
thousands. For the matter of that, he reiterated,
crime had no sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took up each detail of the story, and in the light
of his interpretation Patience was the modern Lucretia
Borgia and Beverly Peele an injured, peaceable, affectionate
husband, who had been sacrificed by an abandoned
woman to whom he had given his honoured
name, his fortune, and his love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scarcely raised his voice. There was no passion
in his utterance; but he manufactured a mosaic, bit
by bit, each fragment fitting so exactly that the design
was without crevice or crack. He demonstrated mathematically
that the tardy evidence of Miss Mairs had
been superfluous; that the chain of circumstantial evidence
was symmetrical and complete, and that no possible
motive beyond duty to her conscience could be
attributed to her. With devilish adroitness, without a
direct phrase, he managed to filter into those twelve
small brains the secret of the inspired eloquence of the
eminent counsel for the defence,—in behalf of his
young and beautiful client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was talking, the skeleton trees beyond the
windows grew dim of outline, the mass of colour in the
gallery faded. An official came out of the library behind
the court room and lit the tall gas lamps on either
side of the bench. The judge looked like a bas-relief
in pink and silver against the dark panelling of the background.
The rest of the room was in shadow. The
light of the near jet fell full upon Sturges’ stern face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience’s life from “its fiendish childhood” was rehearsed
with such consecutive logic that crime at some
point of such a woman’s career was inevitable. The
only wonder was that it had not been committed sooner.
The threats, he demonstrated, whether uttered in moments
of passion or not, were the significant output of
a brooding mind. The “cruel letter to a dying man”
was read with slow and indignant emphasis. Then the
events of the fatal day and night, the quarrels, the
prisoner’s fury at being denied a divorce, the deceased’s
threat to live twenty years to spite her, her carefully
rehearsed and absurd story that her husband had
dropped the morphine himself,—something he knew
himself physically incapable of doing,—the equal absurdity
of his suicide when a greater revenge lay in his
hands, her brutal indifference while he lay dying, were
deliberately gone over with passionless and insidious
effect. The quiet half-lit room was oddly in keeping
with the deadly methods of the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had made the most of her flight on the
morning of the “Eye” story, he paused a moment,
during which the rising wind could be heard in the
trees. Within, there was no sound. No one seemed
breathing. Bourke and Patience were in deep shadow.
With an instinct of protection he clasped his hand suddenly
about hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sturges resumed, with lowered and vibrating voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And—where—Gentlemen of the Jury,—was—this—woman—arrested?——<span class='it'>In
the house of a harlot!</span>”
He paused another half moment. “In the
house of her oldest friend, La Rosita, one of the most
abandoned women in America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke’s hand twitched spasmodically. Simms twisted
his neck, and shot at Lansing an uneasy glance. Patience
shuddered. For the moment she forgot Bourke.
She felt as if a cobra were folding her about,—very
slowly, and gently, and inexorably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Sturges sat down the jury was told to rise.
The judge stood under one of the lamps and read them
his charge. He explained that unless they could find
the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree—of
deliberate premeditated murder—they must acquit her.
As the final quarrel had taken place an hour before the
killing it was obviously impossible that she could have
dropped the morphine in a moment of excitement; and
a verdict of self-defence would be equally absurd. He
also charged them that they were to consider the law
in the case and nothing but the law,—that human
sympathy must have no place in their verdict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke was too able a lawyer not to have the last
word. As the judge sat down, he arose with several
sheets of manuscript, and for twenty minutes asked the
judge to charge the jury so and so, practically recapitulating
all the strong points of the defence. The judge
answered mechanically, “I so charge,” and at last the
patient jury was conducted out of the court room and
locked up. Bourke was surrounded at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tarbox, with Patience on his arm, left the court
house and its crowd behind him, he exclaimed, “By
God, that was a great speech of Bourke’s! There
never has been a summing up like that in my time
before, not even by him. But he’s the smartest man
in Westchester County! Hanged if I don’t think he’s
the smartest man in the State of New York. He’ll be
in the United States Senate yet.”</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner Patience went back to the court room
to remain until ten o’clock, at which time the jury, if it
had not come to a decision, would be locked up for the
night. She sat surrounded by her counsel and the
lawyers that had taken so deep an interest in the case.
Bourke sat very close to her, and once or twice as she
met his eyes she forgot the terrible moment to come.
Few people were in the court house. No one expected
a verdict that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was exactly at half-past nine that the jury filed
solemnly in. Patience’s knees jerked suddenly upward.
She lost her breath for a moment. Bourke
leaned over her and took her hand, regardless of the
curious people surrounding them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be brave. Be brave,” he said hurriedly. “Now
is the time for all your pride and disdain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was ordered to stand up and face the jury,
she did so with an air so collected and so haughty that
even Simms murmured: “By Jove, she is a thoroughbred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of horrible and vibrating silence,
during which Patience’s brain reiterated hilariously:
“Twelve little Jurymen all in a row. Twelve little
heads all in a row.” Then the foreman was asked for
the verdict. He cleared his throat, and without moving
a muscle of his face, remarked,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guilty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The district attorney sat down suddenly and hid
his face with a convulsive hand. Patience resumed
her seat with a mien as stolid as that of the twelve
jurors. Bourke’s face blanched, but he sprang to his
feet and demanded that the jury be polled. Each
solemn “Yes,” twelve and unhesitating, sounded like a
knell. Then Bourke demanded a Stay, which was
granted by the impassive judge, and Patience was led
through the silent crowd from the court room to her
cell. Tarbox escorted her mutely, his face turned
away. At the door of her cell he attempted to speak,
but gave it up and retreated hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience threw off her hat and sat down on the edge
of the bed. The verdict, she knew now, had not been
a surprise. But she thought little of the verdict. She
was waiting for something else. It came in a moment.
She heard a quick impatient step on the ground below,
then a rapid ascent of stair, a word or two at the door,
Tarbox’s retreating step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke was in the cell. His face was white, but
that of Patience as she rose and confronted him was
not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care!” she said. “I don’t care! I believe
I am happier than any woman alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red sprang to his face. He took her outstretched
hands and held them to lips and eyes for a
moment, then caught her in his arms and kissed her
until the rest of the world lay dull, and all life was in
that quiet cell.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A year later they took her to Sing Sing. The General
Term had refused her a new trial, the Court of Appeals
had sustained the lower court. Bourke had won
nothing but additional glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not go with her to Sing Sing. She saw him
alone for an hour before Tarbox came to take her
away. Her composure was greater than his. He was
torn with horror and defeat, and his surpassing love
for the woman. Not that he had given up hope by
any means, nor the fight; but he knew the fearful odds,
and he cursed the law which he had outwitted and
played with so often and so brilliantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we were back in the middle ages,” he said
savagely, “when a man took his rights and regulated
justice by brute force. We are not half men now that
we are under the yoke of a thing that operates blindly,
and strikes by chance where it should strike, in nine
cases out of ten. Good God! Good God! it seems
incredible that I can <span class='it'>let</span> you go, that I shall stand by
and see Tarbox lead you away. Think of the combined
intellect of the world and the centuries having done
no more for man than that. I must stand aside and
see you go to a hideous cell in the Death House—O
my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had awakened the woman down to the depths;
to-day he called to life the maternal instinct in her.
She put her arms about him with the passionate
strength of one who would transmit courage and hope
through physical pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said; “I don’t mind one cell more
than another—and I know, I <span class='it'>know</span>, that you will save
me. I feel it. I am not going to die. You are a
man of genius. Everybody says that—everybody—I
know that you will have an inspiration at the last
minute. And I have been happy, happy, happy!
Don’t forget that—not ever. I would go through
twenty times what I have suffered in all my life for this
past year. Don’t you think I can live on that for a
month or two? Why, I can feel your touch, the
pressure of your arms for hours after you leave me.
I shall be with you every minute—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw back his head, shaking it with a brief
violent motion characteristic of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” he said, “very well; it is not for me
to be weak when you are strong. Perhaps it is because
the prize is so great that the fight is so long and desperate.
Oh, you wonderful woman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” he said after a moment, “that it has all
been as perfect to you as to me. I want to hear you
say that, but I know it, I know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—I—I—”</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>Tarbox came and took her away. He looked as if
he had lost home and friends and fortune, and did not
speak from White Plains to Sing Sing. The details of
the trip interested her less than such details are supposed
to interest the condemned that look their last
on sky and land; her head ached, and the glare of the
Hudson blinded her; but as the train neared Sing
Sing she opened her eyes suddenly, then sat forward
with a note of admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river was covered with a dense rosy mist which
half obscured the opposite shore, giving it the effect of
an irregular group of islands. Above was a calm lake
of yellow fire surrounded by heavy billows of boiling
gold; beyond, storm clouds, growing larger and darker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drove, a few moments later, to the prison,
the great grey battlemented pile was swimming in the
same rosy glow. Patience murmured satirically:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“‘The splendour falls on castle walls.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Tarbox looked at her in amazement. “Oh,” he
said, “how do you manage it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All hope is not gone,” she replied; “there is still
the governor.” But she knew how slender that hope
was. The governor was on the eve of re-election; public
feeling was multiplied against her; the “Eye” was
clamouring for her life, and strutting like a turkey cock;
the “Eye” and Tammany Hall were one; the governor
was the creature of Tammany Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warden was in his office. He greeted her with
elaborate politeness, albeit puffed with alcohol and
pride. She handed him what valuables she had not
presented to Tarbox, and answered his questions in a
manner not calculated to placate his Irish dignity.
Then she turned to say good-bye to Tarbox, but he
had disappeared. The head-keeper, a big kindly man,
who pressed her arm in a paternal manner, led her
down long echoing corridors, past rows and tiers of
cells, and yards full of Things in striped garments, and
talked to her in the manner one adopts to a frightened
child, until she said:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not going to have hysterics; nor am I at all
sure that I am to be executed—but please don’t
imagine that I don’t appreciate your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I like that,” he said. “To tell the truth
the prospect of having a woman here has half scared
me out of my wits. But if you won’t take on, I’ll do
everything I can to make you comfortable. We’ve
put a woman servant in there to wait on you. I hope
myself it won’t be for long. The evidence is pretty
black, but some of us has our opinion all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I go into the Death House? I think I
shouldn’t mind it so much if they’d put me anywhere
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you must, ma’am. That’s the custom
in these parts.” He opened a door with a huge key,
and Patience did not need to be told that she was
in the famous Death House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long corridor with a high window at either end;
on one side a row of cells separated from the main
corridor by an iron fence sufficiently removed from the
cells to make space for a narrow promenade. Where
the middle cell should have been was a dark arched
stone passage terminated by a stout oaken door.
Patience knew that it led to the execution room. Two
guards walked up and down the corridor. At the end,
a sullen-looking woman stood over a stove, making tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got the house all to yourself,” said the
keeper, with an attempt at jocularity. “If there’d
been any men here I guess you’d have been sent to
Dannemora, but it’s always Sing Sing for the swells,
when it’s possible, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the gate of the iron fence and led her
down to the cell at the extreme end. It was large and
well lighted, but very different from the cell at White
Plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to lock me in?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am, I must. If everything ain’t comfortable,
just let me know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key grated in the lock. The head-keeper
with an encouraging smile walked away. Patience
crouched in a corner, for the first time fully realising
the awfulness of her position, her imagination leaping
to the room beyond the passage. What did it look
like, that horrible chair? How long—how long—the
hideously practical details of electric execution—the
awful mystery of it—the new death to which imagination
had not yet become accustomed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sound but the monotonous pacing of
the death watch. The world beyond those stone
walls might have sprung away into space, leaving the
great beautiful prison alone on a whirling fragment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet and clenched her hands.
“I’ll not go mad and make an everlasting fool of
myself,” she thought. “If I have to die, I’ll die with
my head up and my eyes dry. If I have the blood of
the aristocrat in me I’ll prove it then, not die like a
flabby woman of the people. The people! O God,
how I hate the people!”</p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A great petition was sent to the governor. It was
signed uniformly by men and women of the upper
class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not the aristocrats that do the electing in the
United States. The lower classes were against her to a
man. Her personality enraged them; her unreligion,
her disdainful bearing, her intellect, her position,
antagonised the superstitious and ambitious masses
more than her crime. Inevitable result: the governor
refused to pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora returned to Peele Manor from town in April.
Bourke’s attempts to see her were frustrated by a bodyguard
of servants. He took up his residence in the
little village adjoining the grounds. He hardly knew
what he hoped. But Honora Mairs was the last and
only resource, and he could not keep away from her
vicinity. He did not go to Sing Sing. It had been
agreed between himself and Patience that he should
stay away: they had no desire to communicate through
iron bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution was set for the seventh of May. On
the evening of the sixth, while walking down the single
street of the village Bourke came face to face with the
new priest of the district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tim Connor!” he exclaimed, forgetting for the
moment, in the sudden retrospect which this man’s face
unrolled, the horror that held him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s me, sure enough, Garan, and I’ve been
hunting for you these two days. I heard you were here,
but faith, I’ve been busy!—not to say I’ve been away
for two weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six months, come June, it is since I left old Ireland;
and I’m wanting to tell you that the creek we
used to wade in is as tempting to the boys as ever,
and that the bog you pulled me out of has moved on a
mile and more. Twenty times I’ve been for going
across the country to call on you and have a good grip
of the hand, and to bless you again for letting me live
to do good work; but I was caught in a net here—But
what’s the matter—Are you ill?—Oh, sure! sure!
This terrible business! I remember! Poor young
thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his arm about the shoulders of the other man
and guided him to his house. There, in his bare little
study, he brewed an Irish toddy, and the two men drank
without a spoken toast to the old times when they had
punched each other’s head, fought each other’s battles,
and shared each other’s joys, two affectionate rollicking
mischievous Irish lads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest spoke finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else is talked of here in the village,” he
said; “but you don’t hear a word of it mentioned over
at the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peele Manor, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you go there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Occasionally—to dine; or to talk with Miss Mairs.
We are amiable friends, although she doesn’t confess
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke raised his head slowly. Something seemed
to swirl through his heavy heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Honora Mairs a Catholic?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is indeed, and, like all converts, full to the brim
and running over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke leaned forward, his hand clinching about his
chin, his elbow pressing his knee with such force that
his arm vibrated. He had been raised a Catholic—he
knew its grip. His mind was trained to grasp opportunities
on the moment, to work with the nervous yet
mathematical rapidity of electric currents. And like
all great lawyers he was a great actor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tim,” he said meditatively, “I’m feeling terribly
bad over that poor girl I couldn’t save.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure and I should think you would, Garan. My
heart’s breaking for her myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you read the trial, Tim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, faith, I didn’t. I’ve been too busy with these
godless folk. Sure they get away from us priests when
they get into America. It’s only one more drop to
hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Tim, you’re right. You always saw
things at a glance. But I’ve got a great work for you
to do,—a great work for you and for the Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have, Garan? You have? Out with it, my
boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember the time when Paddy Flannagan
was accused of murdering his old grandmother for the
sake of the money in her stocking?” continued Bourke,
in the same half absent tone, and lapsing gradually into
brogue. “He was convicted, you know, and the whole
town was set on him, and we two boys were the worst
of the lot. Do you remember how we used to hoot
under his jail window at night? And then, quite by
accident, at the last minute, two days before he was
going to be hanged, you discovered the man that had
committed the murder, and you ran as fast as your legs
could carry you to save Paddy, shouting all the way,—and
that it was the happiest day of your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!” exclaimed the priest, his face aglow.
Bourke had thrown himself back in his chair, his eyes
dwelling on his old friend with a smile of affectionate
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a grand thing to save a human life, isn’t it,
Tim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed; the grandest, next to saving an immortal
soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to give you a chance to do both,—the
soul of one woman and the life of another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garan, Garan, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just let me tell you a few things first, a few things
you don’t know already.” He gave a concise but
picturesque and thrilling account of Patience’s life and
of her trial. As he repeated Honora’s testimony, the
priest, who had followed his recital with profound interest,
leaned forward with sombre brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman lied,” concluded Bourke, abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so. I’m afraid so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if she doesn’t open her accursed perjured lips
between now and to-morrow morning at eleven o’clock,
that woman up there—” he caught the priest’s shoulders
suddenly, his face contracting with agony—“the
woman I love, Tim, will be murdered. My God, man,
don’t you see what you’ve got to do?”</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Honora was lying on a couch in her celestial bedroom.
No incense burned. The screen was folded closely
about the altar. The windows were open. The pure
air of spring, the peaceful sounds of night,—disturbed
now and again by the hideous shriek of an engine,—the
delicate perfume of flowers, played upon her irritated
senses. She held a bottle of smelling salts in her
hand. On the table beside her was a jolly looking
bottle of Benedictine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tap at the door. Honora answered
wearily. A maid entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Father Connor, miss, and he wants to see you
particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him I cannot see him—no, tell him to come
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose hurriedly and smoothed her hair. Mr. and
Mrs. Peele had gone South. She was alone in the
house, and welcomed the brief distraction of the priest’s
visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will pardon me for asking you to come up
here,” she said as he entered. “But I am in dishabille,
and I did not want to keep you waiting. How
kind of you to come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it is always a pleasure to see you anywhere,
Miss Mairs,” he said, taking the seat she indicated.
“What should I do without you in this godless place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several candles burned. The moonlight wandered
in, making a ghastly combination. Honora lay back
in her chair, looking very pale and beautiful. The
priest’s profile was toward her for a moment after he
ceased speaking, a strong lean determined profile.
She watched it warily. But he turned suddenly to her
and smiled, and told her an absurd episode of one of
his village delinquents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, Miss Mairs,” he concluded, “you’ve got to
help me. They’re too much for one poor priest. I’m
not one to flatter, but your face would be enough to
make a sinner think of heaven—sure it’s the face of
an angel! Between the two of us and with the Grace
of God we’ll reform the village and drive the dirty
politicians into the Church or out of the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora smiled radiantly, and held out her hand.
“I will work with you,” she said. “I intend to devote
my life to the Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held her hand closely, in a strong masculine clasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believed it of you. But why don’t you go to
confession, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muscles under Honora’s fair skin contracted
briefly, and she attempted to withdraw her hand; but
the priest held it closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall go to you next week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” he said with soft insistence; “to-night.
Do you know it was that brought me here to-night?
I’ve been knowing ever since I came that something
troubled you—was eating your heart out—but I
didn’t like to speak. I thought every day you would
come to me, and I didn’t like to intrude. But to-night
I said, ‘I will!’ I couldn’t get up my courage
when I first came in; but I’m glad I’ve spoken, for I
know you’ll be after confessing now. Poor girl! But
remember, dear child, the comfort and consolation our
blessed Church has for every sinner. Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora turned her face away, and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest put out a long arm, and grasping the screen
drew it away from the altar. Then he leaned forward,
and laying his hands on her shoulders drew her slowly
forward and pressed her to her knees. He laid his
hand on her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confess,” he said, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Honora suddenly burst into wild sobbing, and
confessed that Beverly Peele had dropped his own
morphine that night, that his shaking hand had refused
to obey his will, and that, blind with pain, he had poured
a fourth of the contents into the glass, mixed it with
water, and gulped it down; that she had not gone to
his assistance because she wished him to die, and the
responsibility to fall upon his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she sprang to her feet and smote her hands
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not intend to confess until all was over, but—I—Oh—it
has been horrible here alone these two
days—but I would not yield to superstition and go
away—and you found me in a weak moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked up and down the room, talking the more
rapidly, the more unreservedly, as the priest made no
comment. And after all the years of immobility it was
joy to speak out everything in her crowded heart and
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am not a monster, I am not abnormal, I am
merely a result. It began—when did it begin? I was
a child when I came here—I remember little that
happened before—it has always been the <span class='it'>rôle</span> of the
poor cousin, I remember no other—no other! never!
never! I had to learn patience at an age when other
children are clamouring for their little desires. I had
to learn humility when other children—while I watched
my cousins take all the goods and joys of childhood
as their divine right. While their little world was at
their feet I was learning to cringe and watch and wait
and smile upon people I hated, and listen to people
that bored me to death, and suffer vicariously for all
the shortcomings of the Peele family when my aunt was
in one of her cold rages. It was early that I learned
the lesson that if I would occupy a supportable position
in life I must ‘work’ people; I must cultivate will and
tact—how I hate the loathsome word—and study the
natures of those about me, and play upon them; that
I must acquire absolute self repression, be a sort of
automaton, that, being once wound up properly, never
makes a false move. I believe that was one thing which
drove me to the Catholic Church,—the unspeakable
relief that I should find in confession,—that and one
other thing—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused abruptly, and pressed her hands to her
face, to which the blood had sprung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loved Beverly Peele,” she continued violently.
“I do not know when it began; when I was old
enough to fall in love, I suppose, and that is young
enough with a woman. When we were children we
used to play at being married. Even after he was
grown and was rather wild, he used to come back to me
in the summer time and tell me that he cared for no
one else. I knew all his faults, his weaknesses, his
limitations, mental and moral and spiritual,—none
better. But I loved him. I worshipped him. He
was not even a companion to me, for I was always
intellectually ambitious. Not a taste but music did we
have in common. I have seen him in raging tempers
that would make any other woman despise him—when
he seemed an animal, a savage. But nothing made any
difference to me. A woman loves or she does not love—that
is the beginning and the end. There is no more
relation between cause and effect in an infatuated
woman’s mind than—Oh, well, I can’t be finding
similes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One night he came in here. The next night I
kissed the pillow his head would lie on. For a year I
was happy; for another I alternated between joy and
anguish, jealousy and peace, despair and hope. Then
a year of misery, during which he brutally cast me off.
It was that which drove me to the Catholic Church—not
only the peace it promised, but the knowledge that
with baptism my sin would be washed away—for when
happiness went remorse began. I have not a brain of
iron, like that woman he married. She could snap her
past in two and fling it behind her. She could snap
her fingers at moral laws, if it suited her purpose, and
know no regret, provided she had had nothing to regret
meanwhile. That was one reason why I hated her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how I hated her! How I hated her! Beverly
never had any reserve, and he made love to her
before my eyes. He was infatuated. His affection for
me was an incidental fancy compared to his mad passion
for that woman. And month after month! Month
after month! And I loved him still!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never dared say to myself that when the time
came I should have vengeance, for such a resolution I
should be obliged to confess; and the priest would
make me promise to thrust it out, or refuse me absolution.
But down in my heart I knew that when the
hour came the temptation would conquer. It came
first when I let him drink the morphine. And when I
saw her in court, when her lover gave me that sudden
suggestion, when I knew that I could send her to that
horrible chair—” She threw out her arms and laughed
hysterically, “O God, I was almost happy again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest rose and stood before her. There were
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor woman!” he said. “Poor woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Honora’s face convulsed, but she shut her lips resolutely
and tapped the floor with her foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is pardon and peace in the Church,” he continued
softly; “and not only for the sake of that poor
girl at Sing Sing, battling to-night with horror and terror,
sleepless, listening to the solemn tramp of the
death watch, counting the hours that are marching her
to that hideous death, but for the future peace of
your own soul, speak out and save her. Think of the
years of torment, of remorse, when you will not have
the excitement of the present, the pressure of your
wrongs to sustain you. Speak out, and I will give you
absolution, and your soul shall know peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Honora threw back her head and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” she said. “I am not so weak as
that. I have no intention of going to pieces at the last
moment. It is only her death that will give me
peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent his long body backward, drawing himself up
to his full imposing height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you thought of what will be the penalty?”
he said, in a low voice, and with an intonation that was
almost a chant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shuddered, but dragged her eyes away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care!” she said passionately. “I don’t
care!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?” he said, in the same voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew two short breaths. “Oh, go away and
leave me,” she said. “Why did you come here? I
did not intend to confess until all was over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you expected absolution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have done any penance. I would have
burnt my flesh with red-hot irons—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a short, scornful laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Church wants no such makeshift penances,” he
said passionately. “It has no use for the sinner that
commits deliberate crime to-day and comes cringing
and triumphant to the confessional to-morrow. We
have no use for such as you,” he suddenly shouted,
flinging out his arm and pointing his index finger at
her. “You are a disgrace to the Church, a pollution;
you are the lips of the leper upon the pure body of a
Saint. We have no place for such as you. We have
only one method by which to deal with you and such
as you—” He curved his body, and his voice fell to
a hollow monotone: “Ex-commu-nica-tion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman stared at him with pale distended eyes,
no breath issuing from her dry lips, then sank to the
floor, a miserable, collapsed, quivering heap. The
priest went to the window and called to a man who
stood on the walk below.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke was pacing up and down among the trees, his
eyes seldom absent from the man standing motionless
in front of the house, or from the light in Honora
Mairs’ window. He struck a match every few moments
and looked at his watch. He lit a cigar, then
found himself biting rapidly along its length with vicious
energy. He flung it away and lit another, puffed at it
violently, then let it fall to the ground as he pressed his
hands suddenly to his eyes, shutting out the picture of
Patience in her cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the agony and doubt and despair of the past year
were crowded into this hour. Would the priest succeed?
Was he clever enough to outwit a clever and implacable
woman? If he had only caught her in a moment
of weakness. But was there any weakness in that
organisation of knit and tempered steel? “He’ll
blarney her,” he thought, with sudden hope,—“but
bah! you can’t blarney a snake. That will go so far
with her and no farther. Only acting can save us. If
he can act well enough to fill the stage on which this
terrible tragedy is set, and conquer that woman’s imagination,
he can save my poor girl, but not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands clutched the bushes as he passed. He
kicked the gravel from his feet. He cursed aloud, not
knowing what he was saying. He felt an intolerable
thirst; his eyeballs burned; his heart hammered
spasmodically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at his watch. It was twelve o’clock.
His spinning brain conceived the wild project of forcing
himself up to that lighted room at the corner of the
house and putting the woman to the torture. And at
that moment he saw the priest lean out of the window
and speak to the notary public, who immediately
entered the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hour later the priest came out of the front
door and toward him. He held a paper in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke was waiting at the door. He took the affidavit
from the priest, glanced over it, and thrust it into
his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said. “I’ll get one of the men here
to hitch up a team and drive us to the One Hundred
and Twenty-fifth Street station. There we’ll take the
train for Forty-second Street, and at the Grand Central
the train for Albany. No south bound local will pass
here for an hour. I happen to know that the governor
is in Albany to-night attending a banquet.”</p>

<h2>XXIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Patience had given up hope at last. Its death had
been accompanied by wonder rather than by despair.
Her remarkable experience with Bourke had led her to
idealise him even beyond the habit of woman, and her
faith in his ability to save her had been absolute. Nevertheless,
woman like, she wove elaborate excuses for
him, and loved him none the less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had dragged itself into twenty years. The
chaplain had called and been dismissed. The warden
had visited her and uttered the conventional
words of sympathy, to which Patience had listened
without expression, loathing the coarse ungrammatical
brute. The head-keeper she liked, for she was the
first to recognise true sympathy and nobility within
whatever bark. Miss Beale had come and wept and
kissed her hands through the bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience! Patience!” she sobbed. “If it could
only be said that you died like a Christian!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can be said that I died like an American gentlewoman
of the nineteenth century,” replied Patience.
“I am quite satisfied to know that they will be obliged
to say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Beale shook her head vigorously. “You will
fail when the time comes,” she said. “Only the Lord
can sustain you. Please, Patience, let me pray with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please let me die in peace,” said Patience, wearily,
“and consistently. I shall not make a spectacle of
myself. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Miss Beale had gone the prison barber came
and shaved a bald spot on the back of her head. She
kept her face in the shadow, her teeth set, her skin
thrilling with horror.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on the edge of her bed until midnight. In
the past two months, despite her faith in Bourke, she
had deliberately allowed her mind to dwell upon the
execution until fear had worn blunt. She was conscious
of none to-night. Moreover, she had the poise of
one that has lived close to the great mysteries of life.
Were she free she might have a lifetime of happiness
with Bourke, but in degree there were many hours of
the past year that in mortal limitations could never
be surpassed. The people had won their fight, but
she felt that she had cheated them at every other point.
For, after all, happiness is of kind, not of quantity.
They could strike from her many years of life, but had
she not lived? And a few years more or less—what
mattered it? One must die at the last. She had
realised an ideal. She had known love in its profoundest
meaning, in its most delicate vibrations. A thousand
years could give her no more than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she lifted her head. The rain was dashing
against her high window and against the windows of the
corridor. She flushed and trembled and held her
breath expectantly. In a moment she lay along the
bed, and in a moment more forgot her evil state.
Memories without form trooped through her brain:
snatches and flashes of childhood and adolescence,
glimmers of dawn, and stirrings of deeps, vistas of
enchanted future, the rising and receding, rising and
receding of Mystery, the vague pleasurable loneliness—the
protest of separateness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she pressed her face into the pillows, weeping
wildly that she should see Bourke no more. The rain
gave him to her in terrible mockery. Every part of
her demanded him. She cared nothing for the morrow;
she had thought of no to-morrows when with
him. Morrows were naught, for there was always the
last; but the present are always there to fulfil or torment.
She shuddered once. The rain had given her
back the power to long and dream; and to longing
and dreaming there could be no fulfilment, not in this
world, now nor ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She beat her clenched hand against the bed, not
in fear, but in passionate resentment that she with
her magnificent endowment for happiness should be
snuffed out in her youth, and that there was no power
on earth to assuage her lover’s agony. She wondered
where he was, what he was doing. She knew that
there was no sleep for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her philosophy deserted her, as philosophy will
when the sun is under the horizon. She ceased to be
satisfied with what had been; the great love in her
soul cried out and demanded its eternal rights. And
her fainting courage demanded the man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts suddenly took a whimsical turn. What
should she be like in eternity shorn of her stronger
part?—for assuredly in her case the man and the woman
were one. Was space full of those incomplete shapes?—roaming—roaming—for
what?—and whither? She
recalled a painting of Vedder’s called “Identity” and
Aldrich’s verses beneath:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Somewhere, in desolate, wind-swept space,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In Twilight land, in No-man’s land,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Two wandering shapes met face to face,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And bade each other stand.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“‘And who are you?’ cried one, agape,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shuddering in the gloaming light,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;‘I know not,’ said the second shape,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;‘I only died last night.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The picture had fascinated her profoundly until she
had suddenly noticed that one of the shapes looked as
if she had left her teeth on her death-bed. She laughed
aloud suddenly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time she felt curious about the hereafter.
Poetry had demonstrated to her that hereafter of some
sort there must be: the poet sees only the soul of his
creations, makes the soul talk as it would if untrammelled
of flesh, and in unconscious forecast of its freedom.
Browning, alone, would have taught her this.
His greater poems were those of another and loftier
world. No wonder poets were a mad unhappy race
with their brief awakenings of the cosmic sense, their
long contemplations of what should be, in awful contrast
to what is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience suddenly turned from the thoughts of the
hereafter in shuddering horror. Then, as now, she
should be alone. Perhaps it would be as well, if she
were to look like that shape.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But she should
know soon enough!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whimsies deserted her as abruptly as they had come.
She realised with terrible vividness all that she was
leaving, the sweetness of it, the beauty of it—and the
awful part allotted to the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had imagined that in her last night on earth—if
it came to that—her mind would dwell on the great
problems of life; but she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke and the priest arrived in Albany at two minutes
past eight in the morning. A hack carried them to the
governor’s house in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke’s ring was answered immediately. He had
his card ready, also that of the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take these to the governor,” he said to the butler.
“We must see him at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The governor took the 8.13 express for New
York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke uttered an oath which the priest did not
rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he leave an answer to a telegram he received
between two and five this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; no telegrams are ever sent here—by special
orders, sir. They are all sent to the State House.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke’s skin turned grey; his eyes dulled like
those of a dying man. But only for a moment. His
brain worked with its customary rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said to the priest. “There is only one
thing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the hackman he said: “Twenty dollars if you
get to the station in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and the priest jumped into the hack. The
driver lashed the horses. They dashed down the steep
hills of Albany. Two policemen rushed after them,
shouting angrily; but the horses galloped the faster,
the driver bounding on his seat. People darted shrieking
out of their way. Other teams pulled hastily aside,
oaths flying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the station in exactly four minutes and
a half. Bourke had little money with him, but he was
well known, and known to be wealthy. In less than
five minutes the superintendent, in regard for a check
for two hundred and fifty dollars, had ordered out the
fastest engine in the shop. In ten minutes more it was
ready, and the message had flashed along the line to
make way for “45.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time every man in the yard was surging about
the engine in excited sympathy. As the engineer gave
the word and Bourke and the priest climbed in, the
men cheered lustily. Bourke raised his hat. Father
Connor waved them his blessing. The engine sprang
down the road in pursuit of the New York express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the flying moments, the horror that seemed
to sit grimacing upon the hour of eleven every time that
he looked at his watch, Bourke felt the exhilaration of
that ride, the enchantment of uncertainty. The morning
air was cool; the river flashed with gold; the earth
was very green. They seemed to cut the air as they
raced through fields and towns, dashed and whizzed
round curve after curve. People ran after them, some
shouting with terror, thinking it was a runaway engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Connor had bought some sandwiches at the
station, and Bourke ate mechanically. He wondered if
he should ever recognise the fine flavour of food again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest put his lips to Bourke’s ear and spoke for
the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you expect to catch the train?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Poughkeepsie. It waits there ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what shall you do if you don’t catch it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on to Sing Sing, and do the best I can. I have
made one fatal mistake: I should have telegraphed to
Sing Sing. But I was mad, I think, until I reached
Albany, and there it is no wonder I forgot it. The
regular time for—that business is round eleven o’clock,
about a quarter past; but if the warden happens to be
drunk there’s no telling what he will take it into his
head to do. But I dare not stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly they shot about a curve. The engineer
shouted “There! There!” A dark speck was just
making another curve, far to the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The express!” cried the engineer. “We’ve side-tracked
everything else. We’ll catch her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later they dashed into Poughkeepsie, the
express only two minutes ahead of them. Amidst a
crowd of staring people, Bourke and the priest, begrimed,
dishevelled, leaped from the engine and
boarded a parlour car of the express. Alone, Bourke
would probably have been arrested as a madman, controlled
as was his demeanour; but the priest’s frock
forbade interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The governor was not in the parlour car, nor in the
next, nor in the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he had been there, a porter replied, and would
be there again; but he had left the train as soon as it
had stopped. No, he did not know in what direction
he had gone; nor did any one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to do but to wait. Bourke sent a
telegram to Sing Sing, but it relieved his anxiety little:
he knew the languid methods of the company’s officials
in country towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were five of those remaining seven minutes
when he thought he was going mad. An immense
crowd had gathered by this time about the station.
Nobody knew exactly what was the matter, and nobody
dared ask the man walking rapidly up and down the
platform, watch in hand, gripping the arm of a priest;
but hints were flying, and no one doubted that this sudden
furious incursion of a flying engine and the extraordinary
appearance of Bourke had to do with the famous
prisoner at Sing Sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At exactly three minutes to starting time the governor
came sauntering down the street, a tooth-pick in
his mouth, his features overspread with the calm and
good-will which bespeak a recently warmed interior.
Bourke reached him almost at a bound. He was a
master of words, and in less than a minute he had
presented the governor with the facts in the case and
handed him the affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said the governor. “I’m glad enough to
do this. It’s you that will understand, Mr. Bourke,
that I would have been violating a sacred duty if I’d
slapped public opinion in the face before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote rapidly on the back of the affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will do for the present,” he said. “I’ll fix
it up in style when I go back. You’re a great man,
Mr. Bourke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bourke had gone. Whistles were sounding,
train men were yelling. He and the priest barely had
time to jump on their engine when they were ordered
to clear the track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bourke glanced at his watch as they sprang out of
the station. The time was twenty minutes past ten.
It was barely possible to reach Sing Sing in three quarters
of an hour. Lead was in his veins. His head felt
light. The chances for his last and paramount success
were very slim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the great engine dashed along like an inspired
thing, and seemed to throb in sympathy. There was a
note of triumphant encouragement in its sudden piercing
shrieks. It tossed a cow off the track as lightly as
the poor brute had lately whisked a fly from its hind-quarters.
It whistled merrily to the roaring air. It
snorted disdainfully when Bourke, refusing to heed its
mighty lullaby, curved his hands about his mouth and
shouted to the engineer:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, go faster!”</p>

<h2>XXV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The town of Sing Sing was awake at daylight. It was
the most exciting and important day of its history.
The women, even the pitiful ones, arose with a pleasurable
flutter and donned their Sunday frocks. The
matrons dressed the children in their brightest and best,
and laid the gala cover on the baby carriage. The
men of the village took a half-holiday and made themselves
as smart as their women. The saloon keepers
stocked their shelves and spread their counters with
tempting array of corned beef, cold ham, cheese, crackers,
pickles, and pretzels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By ten o’clock a hundred teams had driven into the
town, and were hitched to every post, housed in every
stable. A number stood along that part of the road
which commanded a view of the prison towers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women sat about on the slope opposite the
prison, pushing the baby carriages absently back and
forth, or gossiping with animation. Other women
crowded up the bluff, settling themselves comfortably
to await, with what patience they could muster, the
elevation of the black flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reporters and witnesses of the execution sat on
a railing near the main entrance, smoking cigarettes
and discussing probabilities. Inside and out the atmosphere
of intense and suppressed excitement was trying
to even the stout nerves of the head-keeper. The
assistant keepers, in bright new caps, moved about with
an air of portentous solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had Sing Sing seen a more beautiful day.
The sky was a dome of lapis-lazuli. The yellow sun
sparkled down on the imposing mediæval pile of towers
and turrets, on the handsome grey buildings above the
green slopes near by, on the graveyard with its few
dishonoured dead, on the gayly dressed expectant
people, as exhilaratingly as had death and dishonour
never been. The river and the wooded banks beyond
were as sweet and calm as if the great building
with the men in the watch towers were some
feudal castle, in which, perchance, a captured princess
pined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-keeper walked once or twice to the telegraph
table in a corner of the office, and asked the girl
in charge if any message had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the wish that’s father to the thought,” he said
to the warden; “but I can’t help hoping for a reprieve
or a commutation or something. Poor thing, I feel
awful sorry for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn her,” growled his chief. “She’s too high-toned
for me. When I read the death warrant to her
this morning she turned her back on me square.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s awful proud, and I guess she has a hard time
keeping up; but it ain’t no time for resentment. I
must say I did think Mr. Bourke’d save her, and I
can’t help thinking he will yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time’s getting short,” said the warden, with a dry
laugh. “It’s 10.40, and the execution takes place at
11.12 sharp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you make some excuse to put it off a day
or so? It ain’t like Mr. Bourke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much. Off she goes at 11.12.” And he got
up heavily and shuffled out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-keeper took a decanter of brandy from the
sideboard and placed it, with a number of glasses, on
the table. Then he called in the newspaper men and
other witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wandered about restlessly as the men entered and
drank in silence. He carried a stick of malacca topped
with silver. One or two of the newspaper men shuddered
as it caught their eye. They knew its hideous
portent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we’d better go,” he said, after one more
fruitless trip to the telegraph table. “It takes time
to go through those underground passages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the great gates were about to close behind them
he turned suddenly and called a guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it should so happen that Mr. Bourke should
come, or telegraph, or that anything should happen
before—11.16—I can delay it that long—just you
be on hand to make a bolt. It ain’t like Mr. Bourke
to sit down and do nothing. I feel it in my bones that
he’s moving heaven and earth this minute.”</p>

<h2>XXVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was five minutes after eleven. Patience sat on the
edge of her bed, her hands clenched, her face grey.
But she was calm. The horror and sinking which had
almost mastered her as the warden read the death
warrant, she had fought down and under. And she had
drunk a quantity of black coffee. She had but one
thought, one desire left,—to die bravely. Even Bourke
was forgotten, and hope and regret. She was conscious
of but one passionate wish, not to quail, not for a second.
Perhaps there was a slight touch of the dramatic instinct,
even in this last extremity, for she imagined the
scene and her attitude again and again. In consequence,
there was a sense of unreality in it all. She
felt as if about to play some great final act; she could
not realise that the climax meant her own annihilation.
Physically she was very tired, and should have liked to
lie down for hours, although the coffee had routed
sleep. Once she half extended herself on the bed,
then sat erect, her mouth contracting spasmodically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she heard the noise of many feet shuffling
on a bare floor. She knew that it came from the
execution room. She shuddered and bit her lips.
Now and again, through the high windows, came the
shrill note of a woman’s voice, or a baby’s soft light
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later she sprang to her feet, quivering in
every nerve, her hands clenched in a final and successful
attempt at absolute self-mastery. On the door separating
the Death House from the main building,
resounded three loud raps, slow and deliberate. They
reverberated in the ears of the condemned like the
blast of the last trumpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and the head-keeper entered,
walking slowly, and stopping once to hold whispered
converse with the death watch. Patience controlled
an impulse to call to him to hurry and have it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came forward at last, tapping his malacca stick
on the floor, unlocked the door of her cell, and offered
her his arm. He bent to her ear as if to whisper something,
then evidently thought better of it, and led her
slowly to the passage facing the execution room.
Again she wanted to ask him to hurry, but dared not
speak. The death watch turned away his head. The
lace of her low shoe untied, and she stooped mechanically
and fastened it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-keeper asked her if she would like some
brandy,—he would send and get it for her. She
shook her head emphatically. The exaltation of heroism
was beginning to possess her, and she would give
no newspaper the chance to say that she owed her
fortitude to alcohol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked down the narrow vaulted way through
which so many had gone to their last hideous moments.
The head-keeper fumbled at the lock. The door
swung open. For a moment Patience closed her eyes;
the big room of yellow wood was a blaze of sunlight.
Then she opened them and glanced curiously about
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution room was large and high and square
and cheerful. On the left, many feet above the floor,
was a row of windows. At the far end a number of
men that had been sitting on stools stood up hurriedly
as the prisoner entered, and doffed their hats. They
were the newspaper men. She recognised most of
them, and bent her head. At the opposite end near
the door leading to the Death House was a chair.
Patience regarded it steadily in spite of its brilliancy.
It was a solid chair of light coloured oak, like the room,
and supported on three legs. Two were at the back;
in front was one of curious construction, almost a foot
in breadth. This leg was divided in two at the extremity.
Half way up there was a cross piece which spread
the full width of the chair. To this was fastened the
straps to hold the ankles of the condemned. The
chair stood on a rubber mat to ensure perfect insulation.
It was studded with small electric lamps, dazzling,
white-hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the chair was a square cupboard in which
stood the unknown, who, at a given signal, would turn
on the current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two prison guards stood by the chair, one behind it
and one on the right. The State electrician, two surgeons,
and a man in light blue clothes stood near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience turned her eyes to the reporters. The
young men were very pale. They regarded her with
deep sympathy, and perhaps a bitter resentment at the
impotence of their manhood. One looked as if he
should faint, and turning his back suddenly raised something
to his lips. Even the “Eye” man still held his
hat in his hand, and had not resumed his seat. Only one
watched her with eager wolfish curiosity. He was the
youngest of them all, and it was his first great story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience wondered if she looked ugly after her long
confinement, and possibly ridiculous, as most women
look when they have dressed without a mirror. But
there was no curve of amusement on the young men’s
faces, and they were shuffling their feet uneasily. Her
hair hung in a long braid. She looked very young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped the head-keeper’s arm and walked
deliberately to the chair; but he caught her hand and
held her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” he said, with affected gruffness.
He went to the chair and examined it in detail. He
asked a number of questions, which were answered by
the electrician with haughty surprise. In a moment the
reporters were staring, and like a lightning flash one brain
informed another that “something was in the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the head-keeper had lingered about the chair
as long as he dared he returned to Patience, who was
standing rigidly where he had left her, and drawing a
short breath said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have any last words, ma’am, you are at
liberty to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to say,” replied Patience, wondering
if her mouth or brain were speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, speak,” exclaimed several of the reporters.
They had out their pads in an instant; but, for
once, it was not the news instinct that was alert. The
most quick-witted men in the world, they realised that
the head-keeper was endeavouring to gain time. Their
stiff felt hats dropped to the floor and bounced about.
Their hands shook a little. For perhaps the first time
in their history they were more men than journalists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wish to speak,” said Patience, and again
she walked toward the chair. The newspaper men
sprang forward with an uncontrollable movement, but
the guards waved them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful, young men,” said the head-keeper with
pompous severity. “Any more of that, and you go out.”
Taking advantage of the momentary scraping of boots,
he whispered in Patience’s ear, “For God’s sake speak—and
a good long one. You must have something to
say; and it’s your last chance on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to say,” she replied, her brain closed
to all impressions but one. “Can’t you see that I need
all my strength? If you have any mercy in you put
me in that chair and have done with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are not the kind to break down—my
God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence of the prison, the hush without the walls,
was pierced by a single shriek, a shriek which seemed
shot from earth to heaven, a mighty shriek of furious
warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every man in the room jumped. The newspaper
men drew their breath with a hard sound. Only
Patience gave no heed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an engine,” stuttered the head-keeper, “and
there’s no train due at this hour—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outer door was flung violently open. The warden
stamped heavily into the room. His face was
purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why in hell hasn’t this execution taken place?”
he roared. “Get to work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-keeper’s face turned very white. His hand
shook a little. The men stared at him with jumping
nerves. Patience and the warden were the only persons
in the room unaffected by the inexplicable excitement
which had taken possession of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get to work,” repeated the warden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patience walked to the chair and seated herself, extending
her arms in position. Once more her brain
relaxed its grasp on every thought but the determination
not to scream nor quiver. She closed her eyes and set
her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guards began to fasten the straps, but slowly,
under the significant eyes of the head-keeper. The
warden stamped up and down. The electrician came
forward. The surgeon went into an adjoining room
and cast his eyes over his instruments, laid out on a
long table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brain works eccentrically in such moments.
Patience’s suddenly flung upon her consciousness a
picture of Carmel tower. She speculated upon the
fate of her owl. She recalled that the Mission had
been restored, and wondered if Solomon, that proud
and elderly hermit, had turned his haughty back upon
civilisation to dwell alone in the black arbours of the
remote pine tops of the forest. She saw the spray toss
itself into scattering wraiths, as when she had knelt
there—a thousand years ago—a little lonely girl in
copper-toed boots, dreaming dreams that were pricked
with no premonition of life’s tragic horrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned suddenly, recalling her long-lived determination
to take life as a spectacular drama. Life had
gotten the best of her! Assuredly there was nothing
impersonal about this ignominious and possibly excruciating
death. The thought banished Carmel tower.
Her mind was a sudden blaze of light—white light she
thought with a stifled shrink—in which every detail of
the room was sharply accentuated. She opened her
eyes, but only a trifle, lest these men see the horror in
them. Her blood was curdling, but she knew that she
was making no sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sensitised mind received the immediate impression
that the atmosphere of the room was vibrating with
excitement. She saw the head-keeper’s neck crane, his
furtive glance at the outer door. He expected some
one. Bourke!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set her teeth. She had believed up to last night
that he would save her. Why had she doubted him for
an instant? She understood now the diplomacy of the
head-keeper. Why had she not spoken when he had
implored her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to her that the men fastening the straps
were racing each other. She wanted to whisper to
them to lag, but pride stayed her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warden was striding about and swearing. The
electricians and surgeons were whispering in a group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the newspaper men. She met their
gaze of excited sympathy, understood at last the spirit
that animated them, and bowed her head. She dared
not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment indignation routed gratitude. Why
did they not rescue her, these young vigorous men!
They knew her to be innocent. They outmatched in
number the guards. Where was their manhood?
What had become of all the old traditions? Then her
anger left as suddenly as it had come. They were not
knights with battle axes, but the most exaggerated
product of modern civilisation. It was almost a miracle
that they passionately wished to save her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her head was drawn gently back, her eyes covered.
Something leapt and fought within her. Horror tore at
her vitals, snarling like a wolf-hound. But once more
her will rose supreme. Then, as she realised that her
last moment had come, she became possessed by one
mighty desire, to compel her imagination to give her
the phantasm, the voice, the touch of her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wrench with which she accomplished her object
was so violent, the mental concentration so overmastering,
that all other consciousness was extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her ears were pierced by a din which
made her muscles leap against the straps. Was she in
hell, and was this her greeting? She felt a second’s
thankfulness that death had been painless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, out of the babel of sound she distinguished
words which made her sit erect and open her eyes, her
pulses bound, her blood leap, hot and stinging, her
whole being rebound with gladness of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cap had been removed, the men were unbuckling
the straps. The head-keeper had flung his cap on the
floor and run his hands through his hair until it stood
up straight. Round her chair the newspaper men
were pressing, shouting and cheering, trying to get at
her hand to shake it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled and held out her hand, but dared not
speak to them. Pride still lived, and she was afraid
that she should cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she forgot them. A sudden parting in the
ranks showed her the open door. At the same moment
the men stopped shouting. Bourke had entered. He
had followed the guard mechanically, neither hoping
nor fearing until the far-reaching cheers sent the blood
springing through his veins once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was neither clean nor picturesque, but Patience
saw only his eyes. He walked forward rapidly, and
lifting her in his arms carried her from the room.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
